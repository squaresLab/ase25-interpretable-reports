 Add proper synchronization mechanisms, such as mutexes, to ensure that `client_socket` is accessed in a thread-safe manner. A code diff showing the necessary changes is as follows:

#include <pthread.h>

// Mutex for synchronization
pthread_mutex_t client_socket_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void *handle_client(void *_client_socket)
{
    // Lock the mutex before accessing the shared resource
    pthread_mutex_lock(&client_socket_mutex);
    int client_socket = *(int *)_client_socket;
    // Unlock the mutex after accessing the shared resource
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&client_socket_mutex);

    ...
