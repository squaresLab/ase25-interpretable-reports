    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-19843.c at line 26 and 31 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code writes data received from clients without ensuring that the length of the data does not exceed the size of the buffer. This can lead to a buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability can be found in the `recv` function call at line 26 and the `send` function call at line 31 in falcon180b-19843.c.
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or corrupt important data.
    how: An attacker would proceed to exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload larger than the BUFFER_SIZE (1024 bytes). This would overflow the buffer leading to overwriting adjacent memory, and potentially gaining control over the program flow.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix adjusts the `recv` function call to ensure that at most `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes are written into `buffer`, leaving space for a null terminator which is then manually added. This prevents potential buffer overflow and ensures the buffer is null-terminated. Implementing `pthread_detach` ensures that resources of finished threads are released properly.
