    vuln-fix: Path Traversal (CWE-22) in gemini_pro-643 (severity: High)
    what: The provided code contains a vulnerability to path traversal attacks, allowing an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the URL path.
    where: The vulnerability is found in the `handle_client` function in lines associated with reading the client request and constructing file paths:
    ```c
        char *path = strtok(NULL, " ");
        ...
        if (strcmp(path, "/") == 0) {
            strcpy(file_path, "index.html");
        } else {
            strcpy(file_path, path);
        }
    ```
    why: If not resolved, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files, passwords, or other sensitive data, potentially leading to a full server compromise.
    how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request with a path like `/../../etc/passwd` or `/../../../var/www/html/secret.txt`, which would allow them to access files outside the intended web directory.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `path` variable parsed from the HTTP request, as shown here:
    ```c
        char *path = strtok(NULL, " ");
    ```
    code-sinks: The application uses the user-controlled `path` to open a file:
    ```c
            FILE *file = fopen(file_path, "r");
    ```

            }
            
            // Open the file
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The code changes check if the provided path contains ".." sequences, which are indicative of a path traversal attempt, and respond with a "400 Bad Request" without attempting to open the file. Valid paths are prefixed with ".", ensuring they remain within the server's web directory.
    method: UNKNOWN
