    vuln-fix: Missing check for buffer overflow (CWE-120) in gemini_pro-6652.c lines 12-24 (severity: High)
    what: The function `handle_client` receives data from the client into a fixed-size buffer (1024 bytes) without checking if the received data exceeds the buffer's size. This could lead to a buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `recv` function call on line 14 in the file gemini_pro-6652.c.
    why: If this weakness is not resolved, an attacker could overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code, which could lead to a system compromise.
    how: An attacker would send a payload larger than 1024 bytes to the server. Since there is no bound check on the buffer, this will result in a buffer overflow.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function on line 14.
    code-sinks: The actions performed using the received data are currently commented as `//...` and the `send` function call on line 20 which sends a hard-coded response.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the buffer overflow vulnerability by ensuring that `recv` only reads up to the size of the buffer minus one (`sizeof(buffer) - 1`), leaving space for a null terminator. It adds a null terminator to the received data, ensuring there is no overflow.
    method: UNKNOWN
