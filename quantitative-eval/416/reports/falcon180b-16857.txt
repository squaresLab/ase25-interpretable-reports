vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') in falcon180b-16857:21-31 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code potentially allows an attacker to induce a buffer overflow by sending more data than the `buffer` array can hold during the `recv` call.
where: Lines 21-31 in falcon180b-16857:
    ```c
    void *handle_client(void *arg) {
        int client_socket = *(int *) arg;
        char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
        while (1) {
            memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
            int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
            if (bytes_received <= 0) {
                close(client_socket);
                break;
            }
            printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
            send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
        }
    }
    ```
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could allow an attacker to overwrite memory of the program leading to potential arbitrary code execution or crashes.
how: An attacker would connect to the server and send a payload exceeding the size of the `buffer`. This could overwrite parts of the memory and potentially allow the execution of malicious code.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)`
code-sinks: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);`

    ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds null-termination to the received data. This ensures that any string operations such as `printf` are safely handled, preventing potential overflows by invalid data lengths. It also adds a check to handle cases where the buffer is filled completely to not overflow on subsequent operations.
