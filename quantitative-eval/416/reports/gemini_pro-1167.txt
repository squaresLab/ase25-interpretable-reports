vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gemini_pro-1167 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly handle the case where the client sends data exceeding the size of the buffer `buf`, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at the line where `read(client->fd, buf, sizeof(buf));` is called.
why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking control of the server, causing a denial-of-service (DoS), or accessing sensitive information.
how: An attacker would send a payload larger than 1024 bytes to the server, causing the buffer to overflow and corrupt adjacent memory. This could lead to control of the program flow being taken by the attacker.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the socket connection established in the `accept` function call and subsequently read using `read(client->fd, buf, sizeof(buf));` in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The vulnerable action performed by the application is the reading of the potentially oversized data into the `buf` buffer in the `handle_client` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix mitigates the vulnerability by ensuring that the buffer `buf` has enough space for a null-terminator, preventing buffer overflows. Additionally, the buffer is zero-initialized to avoid potential data leaks.
