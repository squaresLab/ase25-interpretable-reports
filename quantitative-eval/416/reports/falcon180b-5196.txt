vuln-fix: Untrusted Data Deserialization (CWE-502) in falcon180b-5196 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability arises from the use of `recv` and other socket functions without proper validation and sanitization of incoming data from connected clients. This creates a possibility for an attacker to send malicious data that can exploit the deserialization mechanism or buffer overflows.
where: The vulnerability is located in the following lines of `falcon180b-5196`:
- `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);` (line 20)
- `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` (line 26)
why: Without resolving this weakness, an attacker could send carefully crafted data that could lead to remote code execution, denial-of-service, or information leakage, compromising the integrity, availability, or confidentiality of the system.
how: An attacker would connect to the server and send a payload designed to exploit the buffer handling functions. This payload could perform a buffer overflow or inject malicious serialized objects, which would then be deserialized without any validation leading to remote code execution or crashing the server.
code-sources: The entry point where user input enters the application is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The actions performed using user input are:
- `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in the `handle_client` function.
- `send(clients[i], message, strlen(message), 0);` in the `broadcast_message` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested changes add a function call `isValidInput` to validate the data received on the socket before processing it further. This validation ensures that any malformed or harmful data sent by a client is identified and handled appropriately, thus preventing the potential exploitation of buffer overflows or deserialization vulnerabilities. Additionally, error handling for the `recv` function ensures any failures are properly managed.
