vuln-fix: CWE-78: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') in gpt35-51180 (severity: high)
what: The code invokes the `system` function with a command that includes user-provided data, allowing potential execution of arbitrary commands.
where: The vulnerability is located in the run_task function in the file gpt35-51180 within the following lines:
```c
void* run_task(void* task) {
    Task* current_task = (Task*)task;

    printf("Executing task: %s\n", current_task->task_name);
    system(current_task->task_location); // Vulnerable line

    current_task->is_running = false;

    return NULL;
}
```
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host system, potentially leading to total system compromise.
how: An attacker could craft a task with a payload in the `task_location` field, such as "rm -rf /", causing it to be executed by the `system` function.
code-sources: The `task_location` field in the `Task` struct is the primary source of user input.
code-sinks: The `system` call in the `run_task` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The fix replaces the `system` call with a `fork` and `execv` setup. This approach ensures the command is executed in a separate process, with better control over the execution and handling of errors. It also mitigates direct command injection because you can exercise more control over the child process.
