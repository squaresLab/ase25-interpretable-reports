vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-71569 at lines (22 and 35) (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly validate the length of the data received from the client before processing it. This can lead to a buffer overflow when copying data into the buffer, potentially allowing for remote code execution.
where: Lines 22 (function handle_client) and 35 (main function)
why: Not resolving this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or crash the server by overflowing the buffer.
how: An attacker would send a payload to the server that exceeds the BUFFER_SIZE limit, causing a buffer overflow when the data is copied into the buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory, leading to control over the program execution flow.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` and `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` both in the `handle_client` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff modifies the `recv` call to only read `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes, ensuring there is space for the null terminator. Additionally, after receiving the bytes, the code explicitly sets the last byte of the buffer to `'\0'` to ensure it is null-terminated. This prevents buffer overflow and ensures safe string operations.
