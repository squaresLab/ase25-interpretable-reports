 
vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-45586 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `handle_client` function. Specifically, when user input is received via `recv` and stored in the fixed-size buffer `buffer`, there is the potential to write more data into `buffer` than it can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability occurs at the line `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the `handle_client` function.
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, system crashes, or unauthorized access, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control of the server.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending more than 1024 bytes of data to the server, causing a buffer overflow and potentially overwriting control data on the stack, such as return addresses, to execute arbitrary code.
code-sources: The entry point is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function where user input is received and stored in the `buffer`.
code-sinks: The action performed by the application is printing the received user input with `printf` in the `handle_client` function.
suggested-fix:

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix null-terminates the buffer to prevent potential overflows and memory corruption. Additionally, the client socket descriptor is dynamically allocated and passed to `pthread_create` to ensure the correct value is used in the `handle_client` thread.
