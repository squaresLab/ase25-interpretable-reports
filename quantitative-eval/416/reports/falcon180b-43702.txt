    vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-43702 at line 60-65 (severity: High)
    what: The code within the `main()` function creates multiple threads using `pthread_create`, passing the address of the loop index `i` as the argument to each thread. This can lead to a race condition because all threads will reference the same memory location for `i`, potentially causing incorrect behavior.
    where: Lines 60-65 in the file falcon180b-43702.
    why: If the race condition is not resolved, it could lead to unpredictable program behavior, including incorrect ghost-to-room assignments and possibly crashing the program. This could be exploited to cause denial of service or other malicious actions.
    how: An attacker could trigger this vulnerability by manipulating thread scheduling, thus causing thread arguments to overlap. This might lead to multiple threads using the same `i` value, leading to undefined behavior or incorrect program output.
    code-sources: The loop index `i` at line 60 in the `main()` function.
    code-sinks: The argument passed to `pthread_create()` at line 63 in the `main()` function.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix resolves the race condition by creating an array `indexes` to store the unique index value for each thread. Each thread is passed a pointer to a unique element within this array instead of the loop index variable, ensuring no race condition occurs.
