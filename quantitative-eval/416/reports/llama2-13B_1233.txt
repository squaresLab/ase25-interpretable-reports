    vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in llama2-13B_1233 (severity: High)
    what: The code assigns a password from a local character array to a struct member, causing an out-of-bounds write, due to the local array going out-of-scope.
    where: lines 20-27 in llama2-13B_1233
    why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a segmentation fault, potentially leading to a denial of service or the execution of arbitrary code.
    how: An attacker might exploit this vulnerability by creating repeatedly invoking functions that manipulate `password_info`, potentially causing corruption in the memory.
    code-sources: Entry point is `main()` which calls `generate_password()`.
    code-sinks: The sink is the assignment `password->password = password_characters;`.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed change ensures that the password is correctly allocated on the heap rather than as a local array. It allocates memory for `password->password` and safely copies the generated password to this allocated memory, null-terminating it to prevent out-of-bounds access.
