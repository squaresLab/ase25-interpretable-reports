    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-21884 (severity: High)
    what: There is a race condition vulnerability in the multi-threaded server code. When a new client connection is accepted, the worker thread is given the same `client_socket` memory address as an argument, which can lead to inconsistent states and potentially handle the wrong sockets.
    where: 
        - accept connection and spawn thread: Line 48-56 in `accept_connections()`
        - thread handles socket: Line 20-31 in `handle_client()`
    why: An attacker exploiting this race condition could cause valid client communications to be mishandled, leading to data corruption, loss of communication, and potential denial of service (DoS).
    how: An attacker can initiate multiple connections simultaneously, causing the same `client_socket` value to be accessed or modified by multiple threads, causing unexpected behavior and potentially gaining unauthorized access.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves dynamically allocating memory for each client socket and passing the allocated memory to the newly created thread. This ensures that each thread handles a distinct copy of the `client_socket` value, preventing race conditions associated with modifying a shared socket descriptor.
