    vuln-fix: CWE-835: Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop') in falcon180b-575 at line 64 (severity: Medium)
    what: The program has an infinite loop that does not exit properly if a client disconnects, leading to a potential denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
    where: ```
    while (1) {
        memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            break;
        }
        broadcast(client_socket, buffer);
    }
    ```
    File: falcon180b-575, Line: 64-72
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit this infinite loop to create a denial-of-service condition by causing the server to run indefinitely, thus consuming resources and potentially crashing.
    how: An attacker could repeatedly connect to and disconnect from the server, causing multiple threads to enter an infinite loop and exhaust server resources.
    code-sources: Entry point is receiving data from client connections via the `recv` function within `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: Sinks are the handling of messages and broadcasting them to other clients with the `broadcast` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the socket is properly closed, and the client is properly removed from the client list when the `recv` function returns 0 or negative value indicating a closed/disconnected socket.
