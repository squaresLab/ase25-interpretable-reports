vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-60811 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability in the code arises from a race condition that occurs when multiple threads attempt to access and modify the shared resource `num_clients` and `client_sockets` array simultaneously without proper synchronization. The code in `handle_client` and `main` uses these shared resources in an unsynchronized manner.
where: The race condition vulnerability exists in the `handle_client` function and the `main` function within the `falcon180b-60811` file.
why: If not resolved, this race condition could lead to inconsistent state of the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable, which can cause the program to crash, behave unpredictably, or allow an attacker to hijack or interfere with the communication channels.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting multiple clients to the server, potentially corrupting the array or causing client mismanagement, leading to a denial of service or unintended behavior.
code-sources: The `accept` function in the `main` function (line with `client_socket = accept(...)`).
code-sinks: The usage of `client_socket` in `handle_client` function, particularly lines with `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` and `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0)`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the race condition by introducing a mutex `clients_lock` to synchronize access to the shared resources `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable. The mutex is locked before any modifications to these shared resources and unlocked after the modifications are complete. This ensures that only one thread can modify the shared resources at a time, thus preventing inconsistent states.
