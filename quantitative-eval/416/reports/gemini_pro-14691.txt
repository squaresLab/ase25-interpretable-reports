vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization (‘Race Condition’) in gemini_pro-14691 (severity: High)
what: The code creates a race condition by sharing the `int clientfd` variable between the main thread and the new thread created to handle the client.
where: The vulnerability is located in the main function, specifically in the section where `pthread_create` is called to handle the client connection around line 72.
why: If not resolved, a race condition could occur leading to unpredictable behavior, potential crashes, or data corruption as multiple threads may concurrently access and modify shared resources.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting or simultaneously connecting multiple clients to the server, causing the shared `clientfd` variable to be accessed and modified by multiple threads at the same time, leading to inconsistent state or crashes.
code-sources: User input enters the application through the `accept` function which assigns a value to `clientfd`.
code-sinks: The value of `clientfd` is used in `pthread_create` to initiate the `handle_client` function, causing concurrent access.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix resolves the vulnerability by allocating memory for each `clientfd`, ensuring each thread receives a unique pointer to the client socket descriptor. This prevents race conditions by isolating the variable's scope, ensuring that each thread operates on its own copy.
