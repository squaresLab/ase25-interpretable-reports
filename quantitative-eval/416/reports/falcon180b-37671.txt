vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-37671 at accept_connections() (severity: High)
what: The application creates a new thread to handle each client connection but does not properly synchronize access to shared resources, specifically the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable.
where: The race condition vulnerability exists in the `accept_connections` function and its usage of `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable.
why: Failure to resolve this weakness can allow attackers to exploit the race condition, leading to undefined behavior, memory corruption, and potentially crashing the server or executing arbitrary code.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing multiple simultaneous connections to the server, causing concurrent writes and leading to memory corruption or unexpected behavior.
code-sources: The entry point is the `accept_connections` function where client connections are accepted and handled by spawning new threads.
code-sinks: The sinks are the usage of `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable within the `accept_connections` function and the `handle_client` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes introduce a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to lock and unlock critical sections that modify the shared resources (`client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable). This protects against concurrent access and ensures that the updates to these shared resources are done in a thread-safe manner, thus preventing the race condition.
