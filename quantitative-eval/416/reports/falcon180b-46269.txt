vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-46269 at lines 23-32 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition due to shared access to the client socket file descriptor without proper synchronization, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potential security risks.
where: Lines 23-32 in falcon180b-46269
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker could potentially crash the server or execute arbitrary code by exploiting the race condition, leading to denial of service or more severe compromises.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple concurrent requests, leveraging the race condition to manipulate internal states and behaviors of the application.
code-sources: The entry point in the code where user input enters the application is the `accept` function in the `accept_connections` function.
code-sinks: The action performed by the application using user input from the source is the handling of the client request in the `handle_client` function.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
    void *handle_client(void *arg) {
        int client_socket = *(int *)arg;
        char request[MAX_REQUEST_SIZE];
        int bytes_received = 0;

+       pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
        while ((bytes_received = recv(client_socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0)) > 0) {
            char *token;
            char *method = strtok_r(request, " ", &token);
            char *path = strtok_r(NULL, " ", &token);

            if (strcasecmp(method, "GET") == 0 && strcasecmp(path, "/") == 0) {
                // Send response for GET / request
                send(client_socket, "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: 12\r\n\r\nHello, World!", 50, 0);
            } else {
                // Send response for all other requests
                send(client_socket, "HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found\r\nContent-Length: 16\r\n\r\n404 Not Found", 46, 0);
            }
        }
+       pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);

        close(client_socket);
        return NULL;
    }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by adding mutex locks around the critical section where the client request is being processed. This ensures that concurrent access to the shared resource (client socket) is properly synchronized, preventing the race condition.
