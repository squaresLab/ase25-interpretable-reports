vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-36897 at lines 61-69 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is caused by not properly validating the size of data received from the client, which can lead to a buffer overflow in `handle_client` function.
where: The vulnerability is located within the `recv` function call at lines 61-69 in the `handle_client` function in the file `gpt35-36897`.
why: A buffer overflow can result in overwriting adjacent memory, which can crash the program or, in the worst-case scenario, allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker can send more than `BUFFER_SIZE` (1024 bytes) of data to the server, causing a buffer overflow in the `buffer`. This could be exploited to overwrite control data and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.
code-sources: The `recv` function call at line 62 is the entry point for user input.
code-sinks: The `buffer` variable at line 63 holds the input data that can overflow.

explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff adds a check to ensure that the received data does not exceed `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes to make room for the null terminator, thus preventing a buffer overflow. It also ensures that the buffer is null-terminated before being used, preventing any potential overflows and format string attacks.
