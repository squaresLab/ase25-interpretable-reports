vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-36826, lines 15-27 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of proper validation of the size of data received from clients. The received data is directly stored into a fixed-size buffer without checking if the buffer is large enough to hold it.
where: The vulnerability can be found in the `handle_client` function within the `falcon180b-36826` file, specifically in lines 15-27.
why: If an attacker exploits this vulnerability, they could overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code, leading to a complete system compromise.
how: An attacker could send specially crafted packets containing more data than the buffer can hold. Since there is no length check before writing data into the buffer, this causes a buffer overflow, which can be leveraged to execute malicious code.
code-sources: The user input enters the application through the `recv` function call on line 20.
code-sinks: The user input is used directly in the `send` function call on line 25 without any validation.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix includes a length check on the received data to ensure that it is smaller than the buffer size. This prevents buffer overflow by discarding data that would exceed the buffer's capacity. Additionally, the `send` function call was modified to use the number of bytes received (`bytes_received`) instead of the length of the buffer, ensuring that no extra data is sent.
