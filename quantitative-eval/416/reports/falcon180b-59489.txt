    vuln-fix: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121) in falcon180b-59489 (severity: High)
    what: The code is susceptible to a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability because the `handle_client` function reads data into a fixed size buffer `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` without validating the length of the received data.
    where: The vulnerability is located in falcon180b-59489, specifically within the `handle_client` function from lines 10 to 23.
    why: If a buffer overflow occurs, it can lead to unauthorized memory access, resulting in data corruption, application crashes, or arbitrary code execution.
    how: An attacker would send a payload larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` (1024 bytes in this case) to the application, causing the `buffer` to overflow and potentially overwriting adjacent memory, leading to a crash or executing arbitrary code.
    code-sources: Entry point is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function where it reads incoming data into buffer.
    code-sinks: The vulnerability manifests when the content of the `buffer` is printed using `printf` on line 20, after data is read from the `recv` function on line 16.

         }

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The fix ensures the buffer is always null-terminated by setting `buffer[BUFFER_SIZE - 1] = '\0'` and limits the number of characters printed to avoid overflow using `%.1023s` in the `printf` statement, thereby preventing buffer overflow.
