vuln-fix: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation in codellama_13b-7434 (severity: High)
what: The program does not perform proper input validation on the value of the `amount` variable entered by the user, which can lead to unauthorized overdraws or deposits.
where: Lines involving user input handling and balance modification, specifically:
  - Line with `scanf("%f", &amount);` under case 2
  - Line with `scanf("%f", &amount);` under case 3
why: A possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that a malicious user could exploit this flaw to manipulate account balances, potentially causing financial loss or inconsistency in the banking records.
how: An attacker could deposit or withdraw negative amounts to artificially increase or decrease the account balance without restriction.
code-sources: The `scanf` calls for reading user input in the `main` function: `scanf("%f", &amount);` and `scanf("%d", &option);`
code-sinks: The actions performed with the user input, specifically updating the account balance in:
  - `accounts[0].balance += amount;` 
  - `accounts[0].balance -= amount;`

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds input validation checks to ensure that the deposit and withdrawal amounts must be positive. It also adds a check to prevent overdraws by ensuring the withdrawal amount does not exceed the current balance. This mitigates the risk of manipulating the account balance through improper input.
