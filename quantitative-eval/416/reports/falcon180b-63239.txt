vuln-fix: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in falcon180b-63239 (severity: High)
what: The `num_sockets` variable, which keeps track of the number of active sockets, is incremented without a boundary check, leading to a potential integer overflow. If `num_sockets` exceeds the maximum value for an integer, it could wrap around to a negative value or zero, causing logic errors or an overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `start_monitoring` function:
```c
void start_monitoring(int sock) {
    pthread_t thread_id;
    pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, monitor_thread, (void *) &sock);
    num_sockets++;
}
```
why: If the integer overflow condition occurs, it could cause undefined behavior, application crashes, or potentially allow an attacker to manipulate memory or gain unauthorized access.
how: An attacker could potentially force the application to accept numerous connections, increasing `num_sockets` until the integer overflows. This could lead to unexpected behaviors in the application's logic or exhaustion of system resources.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the `accept` function in the `main` function.
code-sinks: The action associated with the vulnerability is the increment of the `num_sockets` variable in the `start_monitoring` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix adds a condition to check if `num_sockets` has reached `MAX_SOCKETS`. If it has, the code prints an error message, closes the socket, and exits the function without incrementing `num_sockets`. This prevents integer overflow and maintains the integrity of socket management.
