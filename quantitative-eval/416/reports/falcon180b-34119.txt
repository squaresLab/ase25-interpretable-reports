    vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-34119 (severity: high)
    what: The code is susceptible to a buffer overflow attack due to the handling of user input in the `handle_client` function.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function in the `falcon180b-34119` file, specifically at the `recv` and `send` calls.
    why: Failure to resolve this weakness can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, resulting in system compromise, data corruption, or crashes.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending messages larger than the `MAX_MSG_LEN` (1024 bytes), which can overwrite adjacent memory and potentially execute malicious code.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` call in the `handle_client` function, which receives data from connected clients.
    code-sinks: The buffer from the `recv` call is used directly in the `send` call for broadcasting messages, which means it's performed using potentially untrusted data.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer always null-terminates by reserving one byte for the null-termination character. It also checks for potential buffer overflow by verifying the number of bytes received. These changes prevent overwriting adjacent memory and mitigate the risk of buffer overflow exploitation.
