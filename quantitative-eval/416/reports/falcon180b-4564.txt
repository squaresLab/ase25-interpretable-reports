    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-4564 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a race condition due to improper synchronization of the shared resource `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable.
    where: The issue is located in the file falcon180b-4564 at the lines where `client_sockets` and `num_clients` are accessed and modified, particularly in the `main` function and `handle_client` function where new clients are added and messages are relayed.
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it can lead to undefined behavior, resource leaks, or application crashes, particularly when multiple threads access and modify shared resources concurrently.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple client connections concurrently, potentially causing inconsistencies in the `client_sockets` array or `num_clients` variable, leading to race conditions and potentially crashing the server.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the `accept()` function in the `main` function which accepts incoming client connections.
    code-sinks: The `recv()` and `send()` functions in the `handle_client` function are where the application processes user input from a source.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by introducing a mutex `clients_mutex` to properly synchronize access to the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable. The mutex ensures that only one thread can access and modify these shared resources at a time, thus preventing race conditions.
    method: UNKNOWN
