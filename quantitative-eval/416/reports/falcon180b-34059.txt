    vuln-fix: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in falcon180b-34059 at line 47 (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly handle the maximum number of connections, which may lead to an integer overflow or wraparound.
    where: The vulnerable code is located in falcon180b-34059 at line 47:
    
        if (num_connections >= MAX_CONNECTIONS) {
            send(client_socket, "Server is full\n", 16, 0);
            close(client_socket);
        } else {
            connections[num_connections++] = client_socket;
            pthread_t thread_id;
            pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void*) &client_socket);
        }
    
    why: If not resolved, this can allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) by creating excessive connections, eventually leading to server crash or unexpected behavior due to storage issues.
    how: An attacker could continuously initiate connection requests. Upon reaching the maximum number of connections, if the counter wraps around due to insufficient boundary checks, it could lead to memory corruption or crashes.
    code-sources: The primary entry point for user input is via network connections handled by `accept()`, `recv()`, and subsequent handling in `handle_client()`.
    code-sinks: User input is used in the server's connection handling logic within `handle_client()` method and in the connection acceptance loop (`while (1)` in the main function).

         }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the number of connections is validated before modifying the connection count. This prevents the integer from wrapping around and causing buffer overflow. Additionally, changing the way `client_socket` is passed to `pthread_create` by using dynamic memory allocation avoids potential issues with the same address being used by all threads.
