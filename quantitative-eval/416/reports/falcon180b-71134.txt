    vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-71134 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a race condition in the management of shared data among multiple threads. The `light_number` and `sensor_number` variables, passed by reference to each thread, are shared and may be updated concurrently, leading to undefined behavior and potential abnormal program operation.
    where: The issue occurs in the pthread creation within the `main` function (lines 34-39). This affects the `light_thread` and `sensor_thread` functions (lines 15-31).
    why: If the race condition occurs, it can lead to incorrect updates to the `light_values` and `sensor_values` arrays, causing logical errors in the system's operation. This can degrade the reliability and correctness of the lighting and sensing system, also making it unpredictable.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by intentionally inducing a race condition, potentially leading to denial of service or erratic device behavior. By manipulating the timing of the thread execution, the attacker can cause inconsistent states.
    code-sources: Entry points are created when `pthread_create` is called for `light_thread` and `sensor_thread` functions in the `main` function (lines 35, 38).
    code-sinks: The sinks are the updates to `light_values` and `sensor_values` in `light_thread` and `sensor_thread` functions (lines 17, 26).

    explanation-suggested-fix: By creating separate arrays (`light_indices` and `sensor_indices`) to store the indices of lights and sensors, we can ensure that each thread receives a unique, immutable index as its argument. This removes the race condition on the `i` variable and ensures that each thread operates on the correct index.
