vuln-fix: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119) in falcon180b-37225 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly handle the case where data received from the client exceeds the size of the buffer `buffer` in the `handle_client` function.
where: 
- Vulnerable Code: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);` and `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);`
- File: falcon180b-37225, lines 15-23.
why: If not resolved, this buffer overflow can lead to code execution or data corruption because the attacker can craft input that overwrites memory, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker could send a message larger than 1024 bytes, causing a buffer overflow in the `buffer` array inside the `handle_client` function. This allows the attacker to manipulate the execution flow or corrupt data.
code-sources: The input is received from the network using the `recv` function. 
code-sinks: The input is subsequently processed using `printf` which prints the contents of the buffer.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer has an extra byte to store the null terminator. Additionally, `recv` is modified to receive one less byte than the buffer size to ensure there is always room for the null terminator. This prevents buffer overflow and ensures safe operations on the received data.
