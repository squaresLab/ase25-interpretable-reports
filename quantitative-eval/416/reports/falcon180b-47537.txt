vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-47537 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability due to the unsafe handling of the `client_socket` variable in the `accept_connections` function when it is passed to the `handle_client` function.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `accept_connections` function on lines 34-45, and in the `handle_client` function starting at line 13.
why: An attacker could exploit this race condition to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service by crashing the server, or intercept/modify communications between the client and the server.
how: An attacker could create multiple simultaneous connections to the server, causing `client_socket` to be overwritten in the `accept_connections` function. This could result in multiple threads operating on the same socket, leading to undefined behavior and potential exploitation.
code-sources: `client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);` in `accept_connections()`
code-sinks: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` and `send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in `handle_client()`

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change fixes the race condition by dynamically allocating memory for the `client_socket` and passing a pointer to the client socket to the `pthread_create` function. This ensures that each thread operates on a different socket, avoiding the race condition.
