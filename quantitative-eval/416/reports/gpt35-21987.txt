    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-21987 lines 74-92 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability exists due to the unsanitized reading of data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking in the `server_handler` function.
    where: Lines 74-92 in the file `gpt35-21987`
    why: Failure to resolve this weakness could allow an attacker to crash the server application or execute arbitrary code by crafting a malicious payload that overflows the buffer.
    how: An attacker could send a large message (>1024 bytes) to the server, which would overflow the `buffer` array, potentially leading to a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
    code-sources: The source is the read() call in the `server_handler` function (line 77).
    code-sinks: The sink is the `buffer` array manipulation in the `server_handler` function.

             printf("Received Message: %s\n", buffer);
    ```

    explanation-suggested-fix: By ensuring the buffer is null-terminated after each read, the code ensures that any string copying or printing functions operate on well-formed strings, thus preventing undefined behavior caused by buffer overflows.
