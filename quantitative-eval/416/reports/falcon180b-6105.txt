vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-6105 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability involves an inadequate boundary check on the `buffer` array in the `handle_client` function when receiving data from the client. This can lead to a buffer overflow.
where: Lines around 15-35 in file falcon180b-6105
why: A buffer overflow could allow an attacker to write arbitrary data into adjacent memory, potentially leading to code execution.
how: An attacker could exploit this by sending inputs longer than `BUFFER_SIZE` to the server, causing overflow into adjacent memory and potentially gaining control over the execution flow.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the `handle_client` function
code-sinks: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` and `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in the `handle_client` function

         }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The code changes ensure that the buffer is always null-terminated after receiving data, preventing an overflow by properly bounding the data received.
method: UNKNOWN
