vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-3908 (severity: High)
what: The buffer used to store data received from clients in the `handle_client` function is vulnerable to buffer overflow, as there is no proper boundary check when receiving data.
where: Lines 20-21 in `falcon180b-3908`:
```
recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
```
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the application by overflowing the buffer.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending data larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` to the server, which overflows the buffer `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` in the `handle_client` function, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing undefined behavior.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the call to `recv` in the `handle_client` function, where data is received from the client and stored in the `buffer`.
code-sinks: The application sends the received data to all connected clients via the `send` function inside the loop:
```
send(clients[i][0], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
```

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix changes the `recv` call to limit the number of bytes read to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1`, leaving room for a null terminator in the buffer. This ensures that data written to `buffer` does not overflow its bounds, preventing a buffer overflow attack. Additionally, error handling after the `recv` call can prevent further issues if receiving data fails.
