vuln-fix: OS Command Injection (CWE-78) in gpt35-75127 (severity: High)
what: The code uses the `system()` function to execute operating system commands based on user input without validation, which allows for possible command injection.
where: The vulnerability lies in the handling of `choice` and `confirm` variables within the `main` function of the file gpt35-75127:
- Lines 28-29 (shutdown system case)
- Lines 36-37 (reboot system case)
- Line 43 (view system status case)
why: Failing to resolve this weakness can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system, leading to potential compromise of system integrity and security.
how: An attacker could be able to provide carefully crafted inputs to execute unauthorized commands. For instance, if the attacker manipulates the input choice or confirmation to inject additional commands, they could take control of the system.
code-sources: 
- User input via `scanf("%d", &choice);` at line 17
- User input via `scanf(" %c", &confirm);` at line 29 and line 36
code-sinks: 
- `system("shutdown -h now");` at line 30
- `system("reboot");` at line 37
- `system("top");` at line 43

                }
            } else {
                printf("%s cancelled.\n", 
                       (choice == 1) ? "Shutdown" : "Reboot");
            }
            break;
        }
        case 3: {
-           system("top");
+           printf("System status can't be shown for security reasons.\n");
            break;
        }
        case 4:
            // Exit program
            printf("Exiting program...\n");
            exit(0);
            
        default:
            // Invalid choice
            printf("Invalid choice. Please try again.\n");
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix replaces calls to `system()` with more specific system-maintained scripts or programs (`/sbin/shutdown.sh`, `/sbin/reboot.sh`) which are assumed to be secure and not susceptible to injection. For viewing the system status, the command `system("top")` is replaced with a message indicating this feature is disabled for security reasons. This mitigates the risk of arbitrary command execution due to command injection.
