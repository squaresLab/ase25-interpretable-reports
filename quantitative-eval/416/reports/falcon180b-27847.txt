vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-27847 (severity: high)
what: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow issue in the function `handle_client`. Specifically, if a client sends a message that exactly matches the buffer's size limit, it could potentially overwrite adjacent memory due to improper handling of null-termination.
where: The vulnerability is located in the following lines:
```c
        memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);

        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            close(client_socket);
            pthread_exit(NULL);
        }

        printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
```
why: Not resolving this weakness can lead to a buffer overflow, which attackers can exploit to execute arbitrary code, crash the system, or perform other malicious activities.
how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by sending data that exactly or exceeds the size of `BUFFER_SIZE` without a null-terminator to the `recv` function causing potential buffer overflow when `printf` attempts to print it.
code-sources: The user input entry point is the `recv` function call in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: The sink is the `printf` function call that uses the received buffer without verifying its contents.

 }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change ensures that the received data is always null-terminated by modifying the buffer size and adding a line that sets the null character at the end of the received data. This prevents potential buffer overflow when using the received data.
