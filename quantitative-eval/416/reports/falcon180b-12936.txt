    vuln-fix: Improper Neutralization of CRLF Sequences in HTTP Headers ('HTTP Response Splitting') (CWE-113) in falcon180b-12936 (severity: High)
    what: The `send(clients[i], message, strlen(message), 0);` line in the `handle_client` function does not sanitize user input, allowing potentially malicious content to be sent to other clients. This can lead to HTTP response splitting attacks.
    where: The vulnerability lies in the file falcon180b-12936 at lines 26-36.
    why: An attacker could craft a message containing carriage return and line feed characters, resulting in the injection of arbitrary HTTP headers. This could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS), cache poisoning, or the execution of malicious scripts.
    how: An attacker would send a message containing CRLF characters, which would be broadcasted to other connected clients, thereby exploiting the ability to manipulate HTTP responses by injecting new headers or malicious scripts.
    code-sources: The user input enters the application through the `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` function call at line 17.
    code-sinks: The application sends the unfiltered user input to other clients with the `send(clients[i], message, strlen(message), 0);` function call at line 30.

    ```

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code introduces the `sanitize_input` function which removes any CRLF characters from the input before broadcasting it to other clients. This ensures that the received messages cannot contain malicious HTTP header modifications or inject unintended content.
