    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-20425, lines 29-38 (severity: high)
    what: The code is vulnerable to a race condition because the `start_row` variable, which is used to determine the segment of the image each thread should process, is shared among multiple threads without proper synchronization.
    where: Lines 29-38 of falcon180b-20425
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it can lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or crashes, as multiple threads might read and write to the same memory locations concurrently.
    how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by manipulating the execution timing of the threads, potentially causing threads to overwrite each other's data, leading to corrupted image output, crashes, or the execution of unintended code.
    code-sources: The user input relevant to this vulnerability enters the application when initializing the threads in the main function on lines 29-38.
    code-sinks: The actual actions using user input occur in the `thread_watermark` function, which processes parts of the image based on the `start_row` and `end_row` calculations.
    suggested-fix: 
    ```diff
    int main() {
        image = (unsigned char*)malloc(WIDTH * HEIGHT * sizeof(unsigned char));
        watermark = (unsigned char*)malloc(watermark_size * sizeof(unsigned char));

        // Initialize image and watermark data here

        pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
        int start_rows[NUM_THREADS]; // Create an array to store start_row for each thread

        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
            start_rows[i] = i * HEIGHT / NUM_THREADS;  // Assign start_row individually
            pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_watermark, (void*)&start_rows[i]);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
            pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
        }

        // Save watermarked image here

        free(image);
        free(watermark);

        return 0;
    }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: By introducing an array `start_rows`, each thread gets its own start row value, eliminating the risk of race conditions caused by multiple threads accessing and modifying the same `start_row` variable concurrently. This ensures that each thread operates on the correct segment of the image without interference.
    method: UNKNOWN
