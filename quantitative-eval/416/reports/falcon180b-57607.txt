    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in falcon180b-57607 (severity: High)
    what: The code allows multiple threads to modify and access shared resources `clients` and `num_clients` without proper synchronization, leading to a race condition.
    where: The vulnerability is located in function `accept_connections` and `handle_client` in falcon180b-57607.
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it can lead to unpredictable behavior including corrupted memory, crashes, and potentially malicious exploits that can affect the integrity of the server application.
    how: An attacker can exploit this race condition by quickly connecting and disconnecting clients, causing inconsistent state in the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. This could result in buffer overflow, denial of service, or unauthorized access.
    code-sources: `accept()` in `accept_connections` function and `recv()` in `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: `clients[num_clients] = client_socket` and `num_clients++` in `accept_connections` function.

        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&client_mutex); // Unlock mutex

        pthread_t thread_id;
        pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, &client_socket);
    }
}
```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex `client_mutex` to guard access to the shared resources `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. The mutex ensures that only one thread can modify these resources at a time, preventing race conditions.
