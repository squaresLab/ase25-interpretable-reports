 
vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-34699 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability arises from the usage of the `strtok` and `recv` functions without proper boundary checks on the `buffer` array, posing a risk of a buffer overflow.
where: Lines involving `recv` and `strtok` in the `handle_client` function within falcon180b-34699.
why: Failing to address this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially taking control of the server or crashing the application.
how: An attacker could send specially crafted packets containing long or malformed strings to overflow the buffer, overwriting memory and leading to execution of injected code or causing a crash.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
code-sinks: `strtok` usage following the `recv` call in the `handle_client` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures the buffer is null-terminated after the `recv` call, preventing any overflow from unbounded reads. It also reinforces buffer size limits during the `recv` function call.
method: UNKNOWN
