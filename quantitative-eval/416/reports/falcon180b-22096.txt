vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-22096 lines 14-17 (severity: High)
what: The buffer overflow vulnerability exists because the `recv` function can receive more data than the `buffer` array can hold, which is not properly checked before printing or broadcasting it.
where: The vulnerability is present in the `handle_client` function at lines 14-17 in the file falcon180b-22096.
why: If not resolved, this weakness could lead to a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to overwrite the memory, potentially causing crashes or enabling the execution of malicious code.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message that exceeds the buffer size, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially enabling arbitrary code execution.
code-sources: `recv` function call at line 14 in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: `printf` function call at line 16 and `send` function call at line 18 in the `handle_client` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes add a null terminator to the received data, preventing buffer overflow by ensuring the `buffer` is properly null-terminated. Additional checks are added to handle receive errors, preventing the use of uninitialized memory.
