    vuln-fix: Unchecked return value from 'recv()' leading to buffer overflow (CWE-252) in falcon180b-32662 (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly handle the return value of 'recv()', which can result in a buffer overflow vulnerability.
    where: Lines 14-25 in file falcon180b-32662
    why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to overflow the buffer, leading to potential data corruption, crashing the application, or executing arbitrary code.
    how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message that exploits the buffer overflow vulnerability, potentially allowing the execution of arbitrary code on the server.
    code-sources: Line 17 where the 'recv()' function reads data into the buffer from the client.
    code-sinks: Line 21 where the 'printf()' function prints the user-supplied buffer without proper validation.
    suggested-fix:

    explanation-suggested-fix: This code diff ensures that the buffer is null-terminated by reducing the size requested from 'recv()' by one and then explicitly adding a null terminator. This prevents a potential buffer overflow situation.
