 
    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in gemini_pro-19907 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability in the `handle_client` function, where simultaneous access to shared resources (`client_socket` and `buffer`) can lead to unpredictable behavior and potential security issues.
    where: 
    - `gemini_pro-19907` at the `handle_client` function:
      ```c
        void *handle_client(void *arg) {
            int client_socket = *(int *)arg;

            while (1) {
                char buffer[MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH];
                int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH, 0);
                if (bytes_received <= 0) {
                    sem_wait(&semaphore);
                    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
                    printf("Client disconnected\n");
                    close(client_socket);
                    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
                    sem_post(&semaphore);
                    break;
                }

                pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
                printf("Received message: %s\n", buffer);
                pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

                char response[MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH];
                snprintf(response, MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH, "Hello, client!");
                int bytes_sent = send(client_socket, response, strlen(response), 0);
                if (bytes_sent < 0) {
                    sem_wait(&semaphore);
                    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
                    printf("Failed to send message\n");
                    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
                    sem_post(&semaphore);
                    break;
                }
            }

            pthread_exit(NULL);
        }
      ```
    why: If the race condition is not resolved, it can lead to data corruption, crashes, and security breaches such as Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially allow attackers to manipulate communications.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing simultaneous access to the vulnerable code paths, thereby causing unpredictable behavior in the server's handling of client communications.
    code-sources: 
    - `recv(client_socket, buffer, MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH, 0);` as it receives data from a connected client socket.
    code-sinks: 
    - `printf("Received message: %s\n", buffer);` as it prints out the received message.
    - `send(client_socket, response, strlen(response), 0);` as it sends data back to the client.

             }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: By moving the declaration of `buffer` inside the critical section, we ensure that only one thread can access it at a time, thus avoiding race conditions. Additionally, moving `recv` and `printf` operations inside the critical section ensures that these operations are atomic.
