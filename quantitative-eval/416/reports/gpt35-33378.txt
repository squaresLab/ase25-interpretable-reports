 
    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-33378.c, lines 54, 55 (severity: High)
    what: The `client_message` buffer is directly overwritten by `recv()` without proper bounds checking, leading to potential buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability occurs in `connection_handler()` function at lines 54:
    
    ```c
    while ((read_size = recv(sock, client_message, 2000, 0)) > 0) {
        client_message[read_size] = '\0';
    ```
    why: If an attacker sends more than 2000 bytes, it could overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to remote code execution or crashing the server.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by sending a message larger than 2000 bytes which could result in arbitrary code execution or crashing the program, leading to Denial of Service.
    code-sources: The `recv(sock, client_message, 2000, 0)` function call in `connection_handler`.
    code-sinks: The `write(sock, client_message, strlen(client_message))` function call in `connection_handler`.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: This fix modifies the `recv` function call to correctly use the buffer size and ensures there is no overflow by adjusting `read_size` if it exceeds the buffer. This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring that writes stay within the bounds of `client_message`.
