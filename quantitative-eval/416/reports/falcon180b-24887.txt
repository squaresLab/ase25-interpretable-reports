    what: The provided code is susceptible to an integer overflow vulnerability when `num_clients` surpasses the `MAX_CLIENTS` limit. The line `client_sockets[num_clients] = client_socket;` causes an array out-of-bounds access if `num_clients` exceeds the array's bounds.
    where: Lines 53-55 in falcon180b-24887
    why: If this vulnerability is exploited, it may result in overwriting adjacent memory locations, potentially causing corruption, crashes, or the ability to execute arbitrary code from unintended memory areas by an attacker.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening multiple connections to the server concurrently, causing `num_clients` to wrap around, modifying memory areas beyond the array boundary.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function within the `handle_client` function and the `accept` function in the main server loop.
    code-sinks: The `client_sockets` array assignment in `client_sockets[num_clients] = client_socket;` is the sink where the integer overflow could lead to memory corruption.

```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex to synchronize access to the `num_clients` variable. This prevents integer overflow by ensuring that the value of `num_clients` is safely checked and modified within a critical section, avoiding data races and out-of-bounds memory access.
