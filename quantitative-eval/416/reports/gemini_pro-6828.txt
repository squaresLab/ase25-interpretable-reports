vuln-fix: Unbounded write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gemini_pro-6828: line 110 (severity: high)
what: The function `sprintf` is used to write data into the `resp` buffer without controlling the length of data that is being written. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input message length exceeds the buffer capacity.
where: Line 110 in gemini_pro-6828
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause crashes, or overwrite critical data, leading to potential system compromise or data corruption.
how: An attacker would send a crafted message to the server with a length that exceeds `MAX_MSG_LEN`. Since there is no boundary check in place for the `sprintf` function, the excessive length could overflow the buffer `resp` and overwrite adjacent memory.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the client message received by `read(clientfd, msg, MAX_MSG_LEN);` on line 89.
code-sinks: The user input is used in a potentially dangerous way by `sprintf(resp, "Received message: %s", msg);` on line 110.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix replaces `sprintf` with `snprintf`. The `snprintf` function takes an additional parameter, `MAX_MSG_LEN`, which specifies the maximum number of bytes to be written to the buffer `resp`. This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring that no more than `MAX_MSG_LEN` bytes are written, thus protecting against potential overflows.
