vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-43023 (severity: High)
what: The primary vulnerability in the code is a buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function. The function reads incoming data into a fixed-size buffer (`buffer`), but it does not limit the amount of data read to ensure it fits within the buffer's size.
where: 
- Line 25: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
- File: falcon180b-43023
why: If not resolved, this weakness can result in a buffer overflow, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or crashes, posing significant security risks.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending more data than `BUFFER_SIZE` to the server, causing it to write beyond the end of the buffer. This could overwrite adjacent memory and potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the application.
code-sources: The `recv` function in the `handle_client` function receives user input from a client connection.
code-sinks: The `buffer` array in the `handle_client` function is used to store the user input received from `recv`.

>           }
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change adds a check after receiving data to ensure that the amount of data does not exceed `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` before proceeding. If the received data is too large, it logs an error, and the client is disconnected. This prevents writing outside the bounds of the buffer, thereby mitigating the risk of a buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
