    what: The vulnerability identified is a buffer overflow due to an unbounded write operation when copying the client name without checking its length.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the file falcon180b-614 at line 39.
    why: Failure to resolve this weakness may lead to a buffer overflow, causing the application to crash, or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the running process.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted client name exceeding the allocated buffer size, potentially leading to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.
    code-sources: The entry point is the `recv` function at line 38, which reads data from the client.
    code-sinks: The action performed using this input is the `strcpy` function at line 39.

         sprintf(buffer, "Welcome to the chat, %s!\n", clients[num_clients].name);
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff replaces the `strcpy` function with `strncpy` to ensure that no more than the allocated length of the `name` buffer is copied. Adding a null terminator ensures the string is properly terminated, preventing buffer overflow.
