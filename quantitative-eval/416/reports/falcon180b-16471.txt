vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-16471 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function. The bug occurs because the length of incoming data is not properly checked before using `recv` to receive the data into the `buffer` array.
where: Lines 13-32 in falcon180b-16471
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could send a specially crafted payload that exceeds the buffer size, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash (denial of service).
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending data larger than the `BUFFER_SIZE`, causing a buffer overflow that could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to execution of malicious code or a crash.
code-sources: 
- `recv()` function in `handle_client()` on line 17 where data is read from the socket.
- `accept()` in `main()` on line 43 where the client socket is accepted.

code-sinks: 
- `send()` function in `handle_client()` on lines 28-30 where data is sent to other clients.

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed changes ensure that the amount of data received by `recv()` is always within the bounds of the `buffer` to prevent buffer overflow. By specifying `sizeof(buffer) - 1`, we guarantee that the buffer always has space for a null terminator, ensuring that any received string can be properly null-terminated and preventing overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
