    
vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-662) in falcon180b-59033 (severity: High)
    
what: The code contains a race condition due to improper synchronization mechanisms while accessing shared resources (`client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable). Without proper synchronization, concurrent access by multiple threads may lead to unexpected behavior, including data corruption and application instability.
    
where: 
- `int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);` (Line 31)
- `client_sockets[num_clients] = client_socket;` (Line 37)
- `num_clients++;` (Line 38)

why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness could be that the server may experience undefined behaviors such as data corruption, crashes, or denial of service (DoS) due to race conditions.

how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by simultaneously connecting multiple clients in a rapid succession, potentially causing the server to stumble over improperly synchronized shared data, leading to memory corruption, crashes, or a halt in server operations.

```

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix introduces a `pthread_mutex_t` named `client_mutex` to handle the synchronization of access to shared resources (`client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable). By using `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` when accessing these shared resources, we ensure that only one thread at a time can modify the shared data, thus preventing race conditions and data corruption.
