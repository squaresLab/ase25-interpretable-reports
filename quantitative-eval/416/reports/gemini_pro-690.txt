vuln-fix: CWE-825: Return of stack address in 'parseArgs' function (severity: high) in gemini_pro-690 at line 23
what: A function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory.
where: Line 23 in gemini_pro-690
why: The caller may end up dereferencing a dangling pointer, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential security issues.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by forcing the program to use the invalid memory, potentially causing a crash or other unexpected behavior.
code-sources: The `line` variable in main function, obtained from fgets.
code-sinks: The return value of `parseArgs`.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
char **parseArgs(const char *line) {
-    char *args[10];
+    char **args = malloc(10 * sizeof(char*));
```
explanation-suggested-fix: This fix allocates memory for the `args` array on the heap using malloc instead of on the stack, ensuring it remains valid after the function returns.
method: UNKNOWN
```

vuln-fix: CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805: Unbounded write in `parseArgs` function (severity: critical) in gemini_pro-690 at line 12
what: Buffer write operations do not control the length of data written, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
where: Line 12 in gemini_pro-690
why: Buffer overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, crashes, or denial of service.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a long input line, causing the `strcpy` to overflow the `tmp` buffer.
code-sources: The `line` variable in main function, obtained from fgets.
code-sinks: The `strcpy` function call in `parseArgs`.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
+    if (strlen(line) >= sizeof(tmp)) {
+        // handle error
+        return NULL;
+    }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: This fix ensures that the length of the input line is checked before calling `strcpy`, preventing buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
