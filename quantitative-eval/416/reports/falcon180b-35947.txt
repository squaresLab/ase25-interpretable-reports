    vuln-fix: CWE-825: Return of Stack Variable Address in falcon180b-35947:39 (severity: High)
    what: A function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory.
    where: falcon180b-35947:39
    why: This memory is deallocated at the end of the function, which may lead to the caller dereferencing a dangling pointer, resulting in undefined behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by causing the program to use the invalid memory address, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even code execution.

    explanation-suggested-fix: Allocating memory on the heap instead of the stack ensures that the returned memory address remains valid after the function exits, preventing the use of a dangling pointer.

    vuln-fix: CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-35947:48 (severity: High)
    what: Buffer write operations that do not control the length of data written may overflow.
    where: falcon180b-35947:48
    why: Uncontrolled data writes may lead to buffer overflow, corrupting memory and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by providing input that exceeds the buffer length, overwriting adjacent memory and altering program execution flow.

    explanation-suggested-fix: Using `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` limits the length of data written to the buffer, thus preventing buffer overflow. Adding a null-termination guarantees the string is properly terminated within buffer limits.
