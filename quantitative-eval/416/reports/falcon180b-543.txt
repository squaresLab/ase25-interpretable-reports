vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-119) in falcon180b-543 at line 15 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability in the given code is a buffer overflow when receiving data from a client without proper boundary checking.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function at line 15 of the file falcon180b-543.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could allow an attacker to overflow the buffer, leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash of the server application.
how: An attacker would send data larger than the buffer size (BUFFER_SIZE) to the server, which is not properly checked in the code. This would overwrite adjacent memory and potentially gain control over the program execution.
code-sources: The source is the data received from the client through the `recv` function.
code-sinks: The sink is the `buffer` variable where the received data is stored and potentially causing a buffer overflow.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff addresses the vulnerability by ensuring that the receive buffer is properly null-terminated, and the received data size is limited to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1`, leaving space for the null terminator. This prevents writing beyond the buffer boundaries, thereby mitigating the buffer overflow risk.
method: UNKNOWN
