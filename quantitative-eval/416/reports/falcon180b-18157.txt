vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-18157, lines 14-35 (severity: High)
what: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to improper handling of the received data and missing bounds checking. The buffer used for receiving data from the client (`buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` in the `handle_client` function) can be overflown when receiving more data than the buffer can hold.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at line 19 where `recv` is used to collect data into the buffer.
why: If left unresolved, this buffer overflow can be exploited by attackers to execute arbitrary code, crash the server, or cause data corruption, potentially leading to data breaches or denial of service.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted payload larger than 1024 bytes to the server. Since the `recv` function does not check for buffer boundaries, the overflowed data would overwrite adjacent memory, allowing the attacker to manipulate the program's execution flow.
code-sources: User input enters the application at line 19 (`recv` call in the `handle_client` function).
code-sinks: Data from the user input is used directly in the `send` function called at line 26.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix reduces the number of bytes received by the `recv` function to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` and ensures that the buffer is null-terminated. This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring received data plus the null terminator does not exceed the buffer capacity.
method: UNKNOWN
