vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-68694 (severity: Medium)
what: The `buffer` used in the `handle_client` function has a fixed size of 65536 bytes (BUFFER_SIZE). If the received message exceeds this size, it could lead to buffer overflow.
where: 
- File: falcon180b-68694
- Lines: `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];` and `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
why: Buffer overflow can corrupt memory, leading to program crashes, incorrect program behavior, or potential execution of malicious code.
how: An attacker can send a payload larger than 65536 bytes to the server. Since the program does not check the received message length against the buffer size, the attacker can overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
code-sources: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
code-sinks: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);`

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix ensures that the read size from `recv` is limited to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1`, reserving one byte for the null terminator. This change prevents the buffer overflow by ensuring that the buffer always remains null-terminated with no possibility of overflow.
