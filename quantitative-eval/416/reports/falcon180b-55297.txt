 
vuln-fix: CWE-367: Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in falcon180b-55297 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a potential Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition vulnerability. Specifically, the check on `num_clients` is made before adding a new client to the `clients` array and creating a new thread for the client in the critical section between the check and the increment of `num_clients`.
where: 
    - `if (num_clients >= MAX_CLIENTS)` line 45
    - `clients[num_clients] = client_socket;` line 51
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability can allow multiple threads to add to the `clients` array simultaneously, potentially overflowing the `clients` array, leading to undefined behavior, including crashes, corrupted memory, or security breaches.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly creating multiple connections to force multiple threads into the critical section, bypassing the `MAX_CLIENTS` check and causing an overflow of the `clients` array.
code-sources: 
    - `accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL)` line 43
code-sinks: 
    - `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0)` line 26
    - `clients[num_clients] = client_socket;` line 51

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a mutex `client_lock` to manage exclusive access to the `num_clients` and `clients` array, ensuring that the critical section where the client is added only allows one thread at a time. This effectively prevents the race condition, preserving data integrity and preventing possible overflow.
