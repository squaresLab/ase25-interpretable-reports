vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-59240 (severity: High)

what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `handle_client` function. Specifically, it may occur when the client sends data that exceeds the `BUFFER_SIZE`, and this data is then read into a fixed-size buffer (`char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]`).

where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in line:
```c
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
```
which is located in the file falcon180b-59240.

why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it may lead to potential security issues such as denial of service (DoS), data corruption, or code execution.

how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`, which will result in overflow of the buffer. This overflow can overwrite adjacent memory and potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` in the `handle_client` function.

code-sinks: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer)` that uses user input directly without verification.

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed code changes ensure that the received data is always null-terminated, by reducing the size of the buffer that the `recv` function can fill (`BUFFER_SIZE - 1`), and then explicitly adding a null-terminator after receiving the bytes. This prevents potential buffer overflow and ensures memory safety. We also added a check for the condition when bytes_received is negative, handling it appropriately.
