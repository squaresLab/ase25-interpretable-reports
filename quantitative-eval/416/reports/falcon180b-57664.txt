    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-57664 (severity: Medium)
    what: The code contains a race condition due to the incorrect handling of a shared variable `num_ports` in a multithreaded environment. Multiple threads are modifying the `num_ports` variable without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent and unpredictable results.
    where: The vulnerability lies in the `scan_ports` function within the `for` loop that modifies the `num_ports` and `ports` array.
    why: If the race condition is not resolved, it may lead to incorrect counting of open ports, potential buffer overflow, or even a crash of the program due to uncontrolled resource access.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by triggering multiple threads simultaneously, causing race conditions that result in unexpected behavior or crashes, potentially leading to a denial of service or manipulation of shared resources.
    code-sources: 
    - `pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, scan_ports, (void *) &i);` in the `main` function.
    code-sinks:
    - `num_ports++;` in the `scan_ports` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the race condition by properly locking and unlocking the mutex around the critical section where `num_ports` and `ports` are modified. This ensures that only one thread can modify these shared variables at a time, preventing inconsistent states and potential overflows.
