vuln-fix: Uninitialized Variable (CWE-457) in gemini_pro-724 at line 29 and 34 (severity: Medium)
what: The vulnerability here is due to the use of the variable `years` without proper initialization. The variable is declared at line 29 in the main function, but it can be used uninitialized if the user inputs an invalid choice (option other than 1 or 2), leading to undefined behavior.
where: Lines 29 and 34 in `gemini_pro-724`:
```c
    int choice;
    ...
    int years; // Line 29
    ...
    scanf("%d", &years); // Lines 34 and 36
```
why: Not resolving this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior in the program, which might cause a crash or unintended operation. Specifically, if `years` is used without initialization, it may cause unexpected results when passed to `travelToFuture` or `travelToPast`.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly providing invalid input to manipulate the variable `years` in unexpected ways, potentially causing undefined behavior or crashing the program.
code-sources: The primary entry point for user input is the `scanf` function calls that read user input at lines 17, 29, and 34.
code-sinks: The user input from `scanf` is directly used in the `switch` case at line 29 and passed to `travelToFuture` and `travelToPast` functions immediately after being read.

-                printf("Enter the number of years to travel to the future: ");
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code modification initializes the `years` variable to zero before it gets used. This ensures that in cases where invalid input leads to uninitialized use of `years`, the program will handle it gracefully, preventing undefined behavior.
method: UNKNOWN
