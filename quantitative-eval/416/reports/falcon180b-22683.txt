 
    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-22683 at line 18-42 (severity: High)
    what: The use of `strlen(buffer)` in `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` allows for potential buffer overflow. If the received message is not null-terminated, `strlen(buffer)` may read out of bounds.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at line `for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) { if (clients[i]!= sock) { send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0); } }`.
    why: A buffer overflow may lead to data corruption, crashes, or even remote code execution, impacting the availability, integrity, and confidentiality of the system.
    how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message without a null terminator to the server, causing `strlen` to read out of bounds and potentially causing a buffer overflow.
    code-sources: The `recv(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` call in `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: The `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0)` call in the `handle_client` function.

 ```

    explanation-suggested-fix: This suggested fix ensures that `buffer` is always null-terminated by setting `buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';` It also explicitly checks that the number of bytes received does not exceed `BUFFER_SIZE`. This prevents `strlen(buffer)` from reading out of bounds.
    method: UNKNOWN
