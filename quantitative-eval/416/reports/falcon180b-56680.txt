vuln-fix: CWE-120 Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow') in falcon180b-56680: line 13 and line 53 (severity: High)
what: The application fails to adequately limit the user input size, allowing a buffer to overflow.
where: Handle the input in the function 'handle_client' and store it in the buffer in line 13; accept and store new clients in line 53.
why: Buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or application crashes.
how: An attacker can send more data than the buffer can hold, causing a buffer overflow and potential control over execution flow.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);` in the handle_client function.
code-sinks: `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in the handle_client function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a check in the handle_client function that ensures the bytes received do not exceed the buffer size minus one for the null terminator. If the message is too large, it is skipped, and a warning is printed. This ensures the buffer cannot overflow.
