    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) and Data Race (CWE-362) in gpt35-7751 Lines 18-22 and 75-80 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code does not properly synchronize access to shared resources (`client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable), and does not adequately check the length of received data, leading to possible buffer overflow and/or data race conditions.
    where: Lines 18-22, within the `handle_client` function, and lines 75-80, within the `main` function of the gpt35-7751 file.
    why: Not resolving these issues can result in an attacker being able to crash the server or, worse, execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the server application or expose sensitive data.
    how: An attacker could send oversized messages to the server, causing buffer overflow, or could exploit the race condition to manipulate the list of active clients, potentially leading to improper handling of client communication or server crashes.
    code-sources: The primary entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function on line 18.
    code-sinks: The received user input is used directly in the `printf` call on line 26 and the `send` calls within the for loop starting on line 29.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed code diff resolves the vulnerability by adding mutex locks to protect shared resources, mitigating the risk of data races. It also includes a buffer zeroing step before receiving data and checks for receive errors to prevent buffer overflow and handle unexpected recv return values.
