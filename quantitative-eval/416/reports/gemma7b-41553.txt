    vuln-fix: Command Injection (CWE-78) in gemma7b-41553 (severity: High)
    what: The code makes unsafe calls to `system()` with arguments that include unsanitized user input, potentially allowing arbitrary command execution.
    where: Lines where `system()` is called, particularly involving `scanf()` - lines 10, 11, 13, 15, 29, 35, and 50.
    why: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the hosting system leading to data corruption, unauthorized data access, or complete system compromise.
    how: An attacker can carefully craft inputs that include additional commands; e.g., entering `a; rm -rf /` as input can result in catastrophic filesystem damage.
    code-sources: User inputs via `scanf()` at line 11 for `book_choice` and lines 19, 28 for `summary_choice`.
    code-sinks: Calls to `system()` that utilize user input values.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The recommended fix is to eliminate direct calls to `system()` that involve user-input and use safer library functions. Sanitizing inputs or using fixed lists of known safe commands instead of direct user inputs ensures the system calls are safe and don't execute arbitrary commands.
