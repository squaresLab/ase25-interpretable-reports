vuln-fix: Missing null termination in buffer before printing (CWE-170) in falcon180b-26781 (severity: medium)
what: The vulnerability is that the `recv` function may not null-terminate the `buffer` before it is used in the `printf` function, potentially allowing attacker-supplied data to exceed the bounds of the allocated buffer.
where: falcon180b-26781, function `thread_client`, lines with `recv` and `printf` usages.
why: Not resolving this weakness could lead to attackers being able to inject malicious payloads into the serverâ€™s output, potentially leading to buffer overflows or unpredictable behavior.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message to the server that does not include a null terminator, causing subsequent operations on the buffer to read beyond its allocated memory.
code-sources: The `recv` function call in `thread_client` where data is received from the client.
code-sinks: The `printf` call in `thread_client` where the received data is printed.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
int client_socket = *(int *) arg;
char buffer[1024];
while (1) {
    memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
    ssize_t bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0);
-    if (bytes_received <= 0) {
+    if (bytes_received <= 0 || bytes_received >= sizeof(buffer)) {
        break;
    }
+    buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';
    printf("Client %d says: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
    for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) {
        if (clients[i] != client_socket) {
            send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
        }
    }
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer will always be null-terminated before it is used in the `printf` function. This is achieved by modifying the `recv` call to leave space for the null terminator and explicitly adding the null terminator after the data is received.
