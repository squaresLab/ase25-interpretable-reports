vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-2373 at lines 41-53 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition when multiple threads access and modify the shared `clients` array and `num_clients` variable without proper synchronization mechanisms.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function at lines 41-53 in `falcon180b-2373` and in the `handle_client` function where the `clients` array is used.
why: If not resolved, this race condition could lead to data corruption, unpredictable behavior, or crashes. In a worse case, it may lead to unauthorized access or denial of service.
how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by triggering multiple client connections simultaneously, which could result in the `clients` array being accessed and modified concurrently, leading to data inconsistency.
code-sources: User input is accepted via network connections in the `main` function through `accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL)`, and then processed in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: The `clients` array and the `num_clients` variable in the `main` function and inside `handle_client` function can be concurrently accessed leading to race conditions.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a semaphore to synchronize access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By using `sem_wait` and `sem_post` around the critical section where these shared resources are accessed and modified, we ensure that only one thread can access these resources at a time, preventing race conditions.
