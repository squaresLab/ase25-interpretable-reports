 
    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-69594 (severity: high)
    what: The vulnerability exists because the `num_clients` variable and the `clients` array are accessed and modified by multiple threads without proper synchronization. This can lead to a race condition where multiple threads try to modify these variables concurrently, causing data inconsistencies and potential crashes.
    where: Lines 8, 48, 50 in falcon180b-69594
    why: An attacker can exploit the race condition to cause data corruption, application crashes, or even execution of arbitrary code, affecting the availability, integrity, and security of the application.
    how: An attacker can exploit the race condition by sending multiple connection requests simultaneously, triggering the race condition and causing the server to behave unpredictably.
    code-sources: The function `accept` at line 45 accepts connections from clients, and these connections are then handed off to threads which handle client communication.
    code-sinks: The `clients` array and `num_clients` counter are modified at lines 48 and 50 in falcon180b-69594.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a `pthread_mutex_t` mutex named `client_mutex` and uses `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` to synchronize access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable, preventing concurrent modification by multiple threads and resolving the race condition.
    method: UNKNOWN
