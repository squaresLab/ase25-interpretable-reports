vuln-fix: OS Command Injection (CWE-78) in falcon180b-7188 at line 30-36 (severity: High)
what: The code constructs a command string to be executed by the system shell using user input without proper sanitization.
where: This vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at the lines where `system("echo 'Turning on lights'")` and `system("echo 'Turning off lights'")` are called (lines 30-36).
why: An attacker could supply crafted input that executes arbitrary system commands, potentially compromising system integrity and confidentiality.
how: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker could send a specially crafted request such as "turn on; rm -rf /" which would result in the harmful command being executed by the system.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function where it receives data into the `buffer`.
code-sinks: The sink is the `system` function call, which executes commands passed to the system shell directly using user input from `buffer`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change replaces the calls to `system` with `send`, which eliminates the possibility of executing arbitrary commands by properly handling client requests within the application's scope without invoking the shell.
