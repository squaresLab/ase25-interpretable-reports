vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-49360 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability occurs because the `data` structure is shared among multiple threads without proper synchronization, leading to a race condition.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function at lines 33-43 and the `monitor_thread` function at lines 19-30 in the `falcon180b-49360` file.
why: If this race condition is not resolved, it could lead to unpredictable behavior such as corrupted data, inconsistent program behavior, or crashes, which can be exploited by attackers to cause denial of service or other malicious activities.
how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the timing of thread execution to cause the race condition, resulting in the `thread_data_t` structure being modified in an unexpected way during the creation of a new thread.
code-sources: The user input source is the `/dev/urandom` file descriptor opened in the `main` function.
code-sinks: The sinks are the `read` and `printf` operations in the `monitor_thread` function where the user input data is processed and displayed.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff allocates memory for the `thread_data_t` structure dynamically for each thread and passes a pointer to each thread. This ensures that each thread has its own copy of the `thread_data_t` structure, avoiding the race condition. Additionally, the file descriptor is closed and the dynamically allocated memory is freed after the thread has finished its execution.
