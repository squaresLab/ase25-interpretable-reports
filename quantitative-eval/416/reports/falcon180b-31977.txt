vuln-fix: CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup in falcon180b-31977 (severity: Moderate)
what: The server code does not properly remove client socket descriptors from the `clients` array upon disconnection.
where: 
- In the `handle_client` function:
    - Lines related to `recv` and connection handling.
    - Lines related to broadcasting and maintaining client connections.
- In the `main` function:
    - Lines related to adding clients to the `clients` array.
why: Failure to remove disconnected client sockets from the array could cause resource leakage, potentially leading to denial of service.
how: An attacker could keep disconnecting and reconnecting to the server, eventually exhausting the array's capacity.
code-sources: Functions involving client connections, primarily `accept` in the `main` function.
code-sinks: Functions processing client data, specifically the `recv` call in the `handle_client` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures proper removal of client sockets from the `clients` array upon disconnection, which prevents resource leakage and ensures that the array capacity is maintained.
