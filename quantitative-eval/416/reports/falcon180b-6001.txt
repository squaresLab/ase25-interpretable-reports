vuln-fix: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121) in falcon180b-6001 at lines 30-45 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability within the `handle_client` function, where the `send_buffer` with a fixed size of 1024 bytes is potentially overflowed when `send` is called. Since the actual content is fixed ("ECHO"), it may not overflow in this context. However, if exploited differently it can lead to overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the file falcon180b-6001 at lines 30-45, specifically in the `handle_client` function.
why: A successful exploitation of this buffer overflow vulnerability can lead to a crash (denial of service) or, worse, an attacker can execute arbitrary code, potentially taking control of the system.
how: An attacker would connect to the server and manipulate data in such a way to overflow the send buffer, possibly by crafting a payload to execute malicious code.
code-sources: The entry point for the user input is the `recv` function call inside the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The action performed using user input is in the `send` function call, where `send_buffer` possibly does not properly manage size constraints.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix expands the `send_buffer` to `BUFFER_SIZE + 4` to safely accommodate the "ECHO" string without risk of overflow. Additionally, using `strncpy` ensures that exactly 4 characters are copied to `send_buffer`. This prevents overflow while the buffer handles the prescribed string length correctly.
