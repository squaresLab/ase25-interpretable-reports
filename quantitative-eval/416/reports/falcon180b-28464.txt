vuln-fix: TOCTOU race condition (CWE-367) in falcon180b-28464 (severity: High)
what: The code uses a condition variable and mutex for synchronization but contains a Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function and the `thread_func` function in the file falcon180b-28464.
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior, data races, and potential data corruption or unexpected application behavior.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing a thread to be scheduled out after it enters the critical section but before it signals the condition variable, leading to incorrect synchronization and possible data corruption.
code-sources: Entry points for user inputs are not directly applicable in this multi-threading context.
code-sinks: The critical section guarded by `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_cond_signal`.

#include <stdio.h>

#include <pthread.h>

// Mutex for critical section
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

// Condition variable for synchronization
pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

// Number of threads

// Function to be executed by each thread
void* thread_func(void* arg) {
    int id = *(int*) arg;

    printf("Thread %d started\n", id);

    // Lock the mutex before entering the critical section
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

    // Notify the main thread that this thread has entered the critical section
    pthread_cond_signal(&cond);

    // Sleep for a random amount of time
    sleep(rand() % 3);

    // Unlock the mutex after exiting the critical section
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    printf("Thread %d exited\n", id);

    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    int ids[NUM_THREADS] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

    // Create the threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_func, &ids[i]);
    }

    // Lock the mutex before waiting for the condition variable
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

    // Wait for all threads to enter the critical section
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
        printf("Thread %d has entered the critical section\n", i+1);
    }

    printf("All threads have entered the critical section\n");

    // Unlock the mutex and exit the program
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    // Join the threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves locking the mutex before waiting for the condition variable, ensuring that the mutex is held when the main thread is waiting for the thread signals. This guarantees proper synchronization.
