vuln-fix: CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function in falcon180b-39953: handle_client function use (severity: High)
what: The application does not authenticate clients, allowing any connected client to communicate with the server and other clients without validation.
where: This vulnerability is located within the `handle_client` function and the `main` function when accepting connections in the file falcon180b-39953.
why: Failing to properly authenticate clients can lead to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, or denial of service attacks, compromising the application's integrity, availability, and confidentiality.
how: An attacker would connect to the server without any authentication, potentially sending malicious data to other clients or overwhelming the server with connections to disrupt service.
code-sources: User input enters the application through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: Action is performed using the user input by the `send` function in both the `handle_client` and `broadcast` functions.

explanation-suggested-fix: The added `authenticate_client` function prompts the client for a password and verifies it before allowing further communication. If authentication fails, the connection is closed. This ensures that only authenticated clients can use the service, preventing unauthorized access.
