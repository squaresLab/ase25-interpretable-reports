    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-68206 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a race condition where multiple threads access and modify the `num_clients` array and variable without synchronization.
    where: The vulnerability is located in `falcon180b-68206` in the `handle_client` function and the `main` function.
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it may lead to multiple threads updating the `num_clients` array at the same time, resulting in inconsistent and corrupted data, and potentially crashing the server or allowing unauthorized access.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing multiple clients to connect and disconnect rapidly. This could lead to a race condition with the `num_clients` array, causing memory corruption or inconsistent states in the server.
    code-sources: The code entry points where user input enters are via the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: The actions performed using user input include the `send` function, and the call to `printf`, both in the `handle_client` function.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex, `clients_mutex`, which protects the code sections where `num_clients` and `clients` array are accessed or modified. This ensures that only one thread can access or modify these critical sections at a time, preventing race conditions.
