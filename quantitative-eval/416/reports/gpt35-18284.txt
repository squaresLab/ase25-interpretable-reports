vuln-fix: Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121) in gpt35-18284.c (severity: High)
what: The code might perform out-of-bounds writes when updating indices of the `clients` array due to incorrect size management.
where: Lines 23-40 in `handle_client` function.
why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to crash the server or potentially execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message to the server that, when processed, causes the server to write outside the bounds of allocated memory, potentially leading to a crash or code execution.
code-sources: `read(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);` in handle_client function at line 24.
code-sinks: `write(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer));` in handle_client function at line 31.

explanation-suggested-fix: The fix ensures that the `buffer` does not overflow by limiting `read_size` to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` and by ensuring that `num_clients` does not exceed `MAX_CLIENTS` before adding a new client. This prevents writing beyond the bounds of the buffer and the clients array.
