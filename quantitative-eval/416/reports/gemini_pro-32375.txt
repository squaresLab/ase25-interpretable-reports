what: A function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory, which becomes invalid once the function exits.
where: gemini_pro-32375, lines 39
why: Dereferencing a dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or other severe issues including memory corruption.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by causing the program to use the deallocated stack memory, leading to a potential crash or other unpredictable behavior.
code-sources: getMovieRating()
code-sinks: return rating;
suggested-fix: 
```diff
char* getMovieRating() {
  static char rating[5];
  printf("Enter the movie rating: ");
  scanf("%4s", rating);

  return rating;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: Changing `rating` to a static array ensures that the memory remains valid after the function returns. Additionally, limiting the input length to 4 characters prevents buffer overflow.

vuln-fix: cpp/unbounded-write ('cwe-120', 'cwe-787', 'cwe-805') in gemini_pro-32375 (severity: critical)
what: Buffer write operations that do not control the length of data written may overflow the buffer, causing memory corruption.
where: gemini_pro-32375, lines 37
why: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, system crashes, or other malicious manipulation of the program.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing an input longer than the buffer size, potentially leading to code execution or other malicious actions.
code-sources: getMovieRating()
code-sinks: scanf("%s", rating)
suggested-fix: 
```diff
char* getMovieRating() {
  static char rating[5];
  printf("Enter the movie rating: ");
  scanf("%4s", rating);

  return rating;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: Limiting the input length to 4 characters with `scanf("%4s", rating)` ensures that the buffer is not overflowed, preventing memory corruption.
