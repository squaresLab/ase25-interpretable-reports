vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow Vulnerability (CWE-120) in falcon180b-46171 (severity: High)
what: The provided code implementation is vulnerable to a buffer overflow issue that might arise due to the use of the `recv` function without proper bounds checking on the received data.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function at the line where `recv` is called.
why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a buffer overflow, which may lead to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or potentially gaining control over the application.
how: An attacker can send a specially crafted payload that exceeds the `BUFFER_SIZE`, leading to overwriting adjacent memory and potentially executing arbitrary code or causing a denial of service.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The action performed using the input is the use of the `buffer` for logging and subsequently sending the message to other connected clients.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix introduces a check on the received data length using `strnlen` to ensure the buffer is properly null-terminated. This avoids reading beyond the allocated buffer size and ensures that the buffer handling is safe.
