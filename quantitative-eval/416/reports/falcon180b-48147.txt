vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in falcon180b-48147 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code has a race condition where multiple threads access and modify shared resources (`g_num_clients` and `g_client_sockets`) without proper synchronization, which could lead to data corruption or unexpected behaviors.
where: The race condition occurs in the `accept_client(int server_socket)` function, specifically where it checks and updates `g_num_clients` and `g_client_sockets` array.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could lead to inconsistent state of `g_num_clients` and `g_client_sockets`, potentially resulting in socket mishandling, memory corruption, or application crashes.
how: An attacker could exploit this by creating multiple simultaneous client connections, increasing the chances of simultaneous access to `g_num_clients` and `g_client_sockets`, causing data races and undefined behavior in the server.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `accept` function in the `accept_client` function, where client socket connections are accepted.
code-sinks: The actions performed include updating global state variables `g_num_clients` and `g_client_sockets` within the `accept_client` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the race condition by introducing a mutex `clients_mutex`. This mutex is used to lock critical sections of the code that modify shared resources `g_num_clients` and `g_client_sockets`. This ensures only one thread can alter these resources at a time, preventing data races and ensuring thread-safe operations.
