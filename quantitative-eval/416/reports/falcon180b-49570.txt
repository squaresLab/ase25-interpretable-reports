vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-119) in falcon180b-49570 (severity: High)
what: The code does not correctly handle the buffer length in the `send` function.
where: `falcon180b-49570`, within `handle_client()` function, specifically at the line: `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`
why: Buffer overflow can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or a potential vector for arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker could send a crafted payload to the server that exceeds the expected size, causing overflow into adjacent memory and potentially executing arbitrary code.
code-sources: User input is received via `recv` in the `handle_client()` function.
code-sinks: The `send` function in the `handle_client()` function transmits data to clients without proper validation.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The fix ensures that the size of the data being sent does not exceed the buffer size by using `bytes_received` instead of `strlen(buffer)`, thus preventing a buffer overflow condition.
