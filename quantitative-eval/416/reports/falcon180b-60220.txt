vuln-fix: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation in falcon180b-60220 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input validation and error handling for the 'recv()' function in the 'handle_client' function.
where: lines 21-30 in falcon180b-60220
why: If an attacker sends malformed or unexpected input, it might lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing a crash or allowing arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets that could cause buffer overflows or other unexpected behaviors.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the 'recv()' function called on 'client_socket' in the 'handle_client' function.
code-sinks: The application performs actions, such as printing to the console, with the received data from 'client_socket'.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix null-terminates the 'buffer' to prevent buffer overflows. Additionally, it checks for newline characters before printing the user input to mitigate potential injection attacks or logging unwanted characters.
