vuln-fix: CWE-77: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in a Command ('Command Injection') in gpt35-29447 (severity: High)
what: The buffer used to store data read from the client (potentially user-controlled) is directly sent back to the client without proper validation or sanitization.
where: Lines 40-52 in the function `connection_handler` in gpt35-29447.
why: This vulnerability allows for an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server, leading to potential system compromise, data leakage, or denial of service.
how: An attacker can send maliciously crafted input containing special character sequences or commands, which will be stored in the buffer and then be sent to the client. This could lead to a reflection attack or even execution of commands if other parts of the application process this data without proper sanitization.
code-sources: The data read from the client using the `read` function.
code-sinks: The data sent back to the client using the `send` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code modification includes validation to replace any non-printable characters with a question mark. This is a simple form of input validation. Ideally, you would enhance this with more robust validation or use a library designed for input sanitization specific to the application's context.
