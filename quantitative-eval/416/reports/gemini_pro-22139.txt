vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in gemini_pro-22139 (severity: Medium)

what: The vulnerable code contains a race condition that arises from sharing the loop variable `i` between the main thread and the newly created threads during the calls to `pthread_create`.

where: The vulnerability occurs in the `main` function within the loop that creates threads in the file `gemini_pro-22139`.

why: If not resolved, this weakness may lead to undefined behavior because multiple threads might use the same value of the loop variable, causing unexpected outputs or data corruption.

how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inducing the affected program to perform incorrect operations or crash by manipulating the timing of thread execution, potentially exposing sensitive information or causing a denial of service.

code-sources: The entry point is the loop variable `i` in the `main` function at line 23 that is passed to `pthread_create`.

code-sinks: The application uses the loop variable `i` in the function `thread_function` to determine the thread ID, leading to unpredictable results since the variable may be modified before it is dereferenced by the thread.

suggested-fix: 
```diff
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

// Define the number of threads to create
#define NUM_THREADS 5

// Define the thread function
void *thread_function(void *arg) {
    // Get the thread ID
    int thread_id = *(int *)arg;

    // Print a message from the thread
    printf("Hello from thread %d!\n", thread_id);

    // Sleep for a random amount of time
    sleep(rand() % 5);

    // Return NULL
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    // Initialize the random number generator
    srand(time(NULL));

    // Create an array of thread IDs
    pthread_t thread_ids[NUM_THREADS];
+    int thread_args[NUM_THREADS];

    // Create the threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
+        thread_args[i] = i;
        // Create the thread
-        if (pthread_create(&thread_ids[i], NULL, thread_function, &i) != 0) {
+        if (pthread_create(&thread_ids[i], NULL, thread_function, &thread_args[i]) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_create");
            return EXIT_FAILURE;
        }
    }

    // Join the threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        // Join the thread
        if (pthread_join(thread_ids[i], NULL) != 0) {
            perror("pthread_join");
            return EXIT_FAILURE;
        }
    }

    // Print a message from the main thread
    printf("Hello from the main thread!\n");

    // Return success
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}
```

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces an array `thread_args` to store a unique copy of each thread ID. This prevents the race condition by passing the correct thread ID as an argument to `pthread_create` for each thread, ensuring that each thread works with the intended value.
