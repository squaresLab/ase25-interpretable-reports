vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-46679.c (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition due to shared mutable state accessed by multiple threads without proper synchronization mechanisms.
where: The vulnerability is located in function `push` and the thread creation in `main` function.
why: One potential consequence of this race condition is that it may lead to inconsistent state of the `shared_stack` and `thread_id` arrays. This can result in corrupted data and unpredictable behavior of the application, making it prone to crashes or logical errors.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by running multiple threads concurrently, leading to simultaneous access and modification of shared resources. The unsynchronized accesses can cause a corrupted state, potentially allowing the attacker to manipulate the state and behavior of the program in undesirable ways.
code-sources: The entry points in the code where user input (the thread id) enters the application is through the `main` function when creating the threads.
code-sinks: Actions performed by the application using the user input from `main` function occur in the `thread_function` and subsequently in the `push` function, specifically modifying `shared_stack` and `thread_id`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the race condition by ensuring that each thread operates on its thread-specific `thread_id` and index. The addition of `thread_indexes` array ensures each thread maintains consistency of its stack operations without stepping over each other. Additionally, thread-specific `thread_id` is passed correctly to `pthread_create` to avoid shared state issues.
