    vuln-fix: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation in falcon180b-47262 (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly validate input received from clients. Specifically, the buffer received from the client is not checked for potential security threats such as buffer overflows or malicious payloads before being processed.
    where: 
        - File: falcon180b-47262 
        - Lines: 27-37 (handle_client function)
    why: Failure to properly validate input can lead to various attacks, including buffer overflow, which may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or compromise the integrity of the server.
    how: An attacker could send a carefully crafted message containing a buffer overflow exploit or malicious code, which could result in arbitrary code execution or crashing the server.
    code-sources: 
        - The recv function in the handle_client function on line 29.
    code-sinks: 
        - The printf function using the buffer data on line 32.
        - The send function sending unvalidated data back to the client on line 33.

        ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds input sanitization by checking if each character in the received buffer is either printable or a whitespace character. If any character is not valid, it is replaced with a null terminator. This prevents control characters or malicious payloads from being processed or executed.
