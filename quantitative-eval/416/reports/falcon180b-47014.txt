vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-47014.c (severity: High)
what: The critical issue in this code is a possible buffer overflow due to improper handling of the `buffer` in the `recv` function. The buffer has a fixed size of `BUF_SIZE`, but the code does not properly check if the received data fits this buffer.
where: Specifically, this vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, at the line where the `recv` function is called.
why: If this issue is not resolved, an attacker could exploit it to overwrite the buffer, potentially causing a crash or allowing the execution of arbitrary code, leading to compromised system integrity and possibly full control over the server.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending data larger than 1024 bytes to the server, which would overflow the buffer, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
code-sources: The entry point for the user input is the `recv` function in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: The data received from `recv` is directly processed and then broadcasted to all clients by the `broadcast` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed changes address the possibility of buffer overflow by ensuring that the buffer is null-terminated, preventing out-of-bounds memory access. This minimizes the risk of triggering a buffer overflow by ensuring that only received data within the buffer limit is processed.
method: UNKNOWN
