vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-40415 (severity: High)
what: The function `handle_client` contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker can send more data than the size of `buffer` (BUFFER_SIZE), which can cause writing past the buffer's boundary if not properly handled.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function of the falcon180b-40415 file, specifically on the line where `recv` is called to read data into the `buffer`.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, crash the server, or other unexpected behaviors.
how: An attacker would send a specially crafted large payload to the server, causing the `recv` call to overflow the buffer and overwrite adjacent memory.
code-sources: 
- Entry point: User input is received through the `recv` function call in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: 
- Using user input: The `buffer` used in the `printf` function call within `handle_client`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the `buffer` array is always null-terminated by adding a +1 to its size and setting the last element to `'\0'`. This approach prevents data from overflowing the buffer and affecting adjacent memory.
