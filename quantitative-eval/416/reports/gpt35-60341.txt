vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) and Improper Resource Shutdown or Release (CWE-404) in gpt35-60341 (severity: high)
what: This code contains multiple vulnerabilities: a potential buffer overflow in `connection_handler` due to improper handling of the `client_message` buffer and resource leaks because the socket descriptors are not properly managed.
where: 
- Buffer overflow: `connection_handler` function, line `client_message[read_size] = '\0';`.
- Resource leak: `connection_handler` function, line `free(socket_desc);`.
why: A buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or a crash, and resource leaks can exhaust system resources, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
how: An attacker can exploit the buffer overflow by sending a carefully crafted message that exceeds the buffer size, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code. Resource leaks can be triggered by repeatedly connecting and disconnecting without properly closing resources, exhausting file descriptors.
code-sources: 
- User input is received in `recv(sock, client_message, 2000, 0)` in the `connection_handler` function. 
code-sinks: 
- The user input is immediately echoed back with `write(sock, client_message, strlen(client_message));` in the `connection_handler` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff prevents buffer overflow by ensuring the `client_message` buffer is cleared properly after each use. Changing `free(socket_desc)` to `close(sock)` fixes the improper resource shutdown issue by properly closing the socket descriptor, avoiding resource leaks.
