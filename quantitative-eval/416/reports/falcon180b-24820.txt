vuln-fix: CWE-416: Use After Free in falcon180b-24820 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a Use After Free vulnerability. When `client_socket` is closed (using `close(client_socket)`), the file descriptor could be reused by the system for new connections. However, the same `client_socket` that was closed is later passed to the `handle_client` function, possibly leading to undefined behavior.
where: Lines 38-47 in falcon180b-24820.
why: Not resolving this weakness can lead to undefined behavior in the program, including potential application crashes, data corruption, or unexpected code execution.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple connections to the server, causing the `client_socket` file descriptor to be reused after being closed. This could lead to executing unintended commands or corrupting data in the application.
code-sources: Accept connections on `server_socket` at line 33.
code-sinks: Close the `client_socket` and break the loop after receiving data from the client at line 26.

 ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the closed `client_socket` is no longer referenced by dynamically allocating memory for each client socket before passing it to `pthread_create`. This prevents the Use After Free situation by ensuring `client_socket` can be safely freed within the `handle_client` function after the thread terminates. The malloc'd memory is also freed in the `handle_client` function after the client connection is closed.
