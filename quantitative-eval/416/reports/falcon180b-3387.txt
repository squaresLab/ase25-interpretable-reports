vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in falcon180b-3387 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition due to the improper synchronization when accessing the `num_clients` and `clients` variables shared between threads.
where: Vulnerable lines are 18-35 in the handle_client function and 47-60 in the main function in the file falcon180b-3387.
why: A race condition can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or corrupt data if multiple threads modify shared resources simultaneously without proper synchronization.
how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by connecting multiple clients rapidly, causing the server to access and modify the shared `clients` array and `num_clients` variable concurrently, leading to inconsistencies and potential denial of service.
code-sources: Entry point for user input is the data received via the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: Actions performed using user input are in the `send` function and accessing/modifying the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable in multiple places.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds a mutex lock `clients_mutex` to synchronize access to the `clients` array and the `num_clients` variable. This ensures that only one thread can modify these shared resources at a time, thus preventing race conditions.
