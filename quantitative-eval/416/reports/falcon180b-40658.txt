    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-40658 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code allows for a buffer overflow condition due to insufficient bounds checking on the `request` buffer within the `handle_client` function.
    where: Lines 13-23 in falcon180b-40658
    why: Failing to resolve this buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption by overwriting memory adjacent to the buffer.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted, oversized request to the server, which results in data exceeding the buffer's boundary and corrupting adjacent memory.
    code-sources: `while (recv(client_socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0) > 0)` in handle_client function
    code-sinks: `printf("Request from client %d: %s\n", client_socket, request)` in handle_client function

                printf("Request from client %d: %s\n", client_socket, request);
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds a boundary check to ensure that `recv` does not exceed the buffer size. It captures the number of bytes received (`recv_size`) and then explicitly terminates the `request` buffer with a null character, preventing overflow beyond the buffer size.
    method: UNKNOWN
