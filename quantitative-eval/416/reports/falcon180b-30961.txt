    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization in falcon180b-30961 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a race condition due to improper synchronization when accessing the 'client_sockets' array and the 'num_clients' variable.
    where: The vulnerability exists in the lines where `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed and modified, particularly in the `main` function and within the `handle_client` function.
    why: If unresolved, this race condition can lead to various issues, such as corruption of the stored client socket information, crashes, or even arbitrary code execution due to overlapping memory operations.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing multiple clients to connect and disconnect quickly, potentially hitting a race condition that mismanages the `client_sockets` array or overflows the `buffer`, leading to undefined behavior.
    code-sources: The user input enters through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function and connection establishment in the `accept` function within the `main` function.
    code-sinks: The received input is immediately processed and forwarded to other clients through the `send` function in the `handle_client` function.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds a `pthread_mutex_t` to handle synchronization when accessing and modifying the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable. The use of `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` around critical sections ensures that only one thread can modify these shared resources at a time, preventing race conditions.
