    vuln-fix: Uncontrolled Recursion (CWE-674) in falcon180b-2880 (severity: Medium)
    what: The code contains a potential uncontrolled recursion vulnerability due to the infinite loop in the `thread_handler` function. If a malicious user repeatedly sends data to the server, it could lead to a stack overflow causing the program to crash.
    where: The vulnerability is located within the `thread_handler` function in the `falcon180b-2880` file:
    ```c
    void *thread_handler(void *arg) {
        int client_socket = *(int *) arg;
        char message[MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE];

        while (1) {
            memset(message, 0, MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE);
            int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, message, MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE, 0);

            if (bytes_received <= 0) {
                close(client_socket);
                break;
            }

            send(client_socket, message, bytes_received, 0);
        }

        return NULL;
    }
    ```
    why: If an attacker continuously sends data to the server, the infinite loop in `thread_handler` could cause the server to be stuck processing that single client, leading to denial of service (DoS) for other legitimate clients or even a system crash from a stack overflow.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing a connection to the server and then sending continuous messages large enough to exhaust the stack space allocated for the process, causing the system to crash.
    code-sources: The entry point is the `recv` call in the `thread_handler` function that receives input from a client socket.
    code-sinks: The action performed is the `send` call in the `thread_handler` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix includes several modifications to manage active threads and ensure the server is not overwhelmed. By introducing a mutex lock for client and thread management and adding a limit on active threads, this prevents potential resource exhaustion and ensures the system can handle multiple clients efficiently.
