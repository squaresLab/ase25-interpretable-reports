    vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-10213 (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly manage the received data length in the `buffer` array, potentially allowing a buffer overflow if more data is received than can be stored in the buffer. This can cause the program to behave unexpectedly or even crash.
    where: The vulnerability is located within the `handle_client` function, specifically on the line where `recv` is called to populate the `buffer`.
    why: Failing to resolve this weakness can lead to various issues, including crashing the application, overwriting adjacent memory, and creating an entry point for executing arbitrary code, potentially leading to a full system compromise.
    how: An attacker could send a payload larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` to overflow the buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory spaces, potentially corrupting the program's state, causing it to crash, or enabling execution of malicious code.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function where data is received from the socket: `int bytes_received = recv(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
    code-sinks: The sink is the `buffer` array which directly receives user input from the `recv` call.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that the `buffer` array has a null terminator. By extending the buffer size to `BUFFER_SIZE + 1`, there is additional space for the null character. Additionally, it ensures that if bytes received equals `BUFFER_SIZE`, the last byte in the buffer is set to `\0`, preventing a buffer overflow.
