    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-62997 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability arises from not restricting the size of data read into the buffer in the function `handle_client`. This can lead to buffer overflow because `recv` does not ensure the data fits within the 1024-byte `buffer`.
    where: The code lines for vulnerability are in the `handle_client` function:
    ```c
    char buffer[1024];
    ...
    int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    ```
    why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform a buffer overflow, which may lead to arbitrary code execution, crashing the server, or leaking sensitive information.
    how: An attacker would send a message longer than 1024 bytes to the server. Since `recv` does not limit the incoming data to the bounds of `buffer`, it will overflow and overwrite adjacent memory.
    code-sources: The source of user input is the `recv` call:
    ```c
    int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    ```
    code-sinks: The vulnerable use of `buffer` can be at:
    ```c
    printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
    send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
    ```

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that at most `1023` bytes are read into the buffer, leaving space for the null terminator (`'\0'`). The buffer's last position is explicitly set to `'\0'` which prevents buffer overflow and ensures the string is null-terminated.
    method: UNKNOWN
