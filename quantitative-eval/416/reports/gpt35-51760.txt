    vuln-fix: Uncontrolled Data in Critical Code Section (CWE-362) in gpt35-51760.c:56-63 (severity: High)
    what: The code creates a new thread for each received packet without proper synchronization or resource management.
    where: Lines 56-63, `gpt35-51760.c`
    why: If an attacker sends a large number of packets rapidly, it can exhaust system resources, leading to a denial of service (DoS) due to uncontrolled thread creation.
    how: An attacker would send a large number of packets to the server, causing it to spawn an excessive number of threads very quickly, overwhelming system resources.
    code-sources: The user input enters the application through the `recvfrom` function at line 52.
    code-sinks: The user input is used in creating new threads with `pthread_create` at line 60.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix changes the code to process packets in the main thread instead of creating a new thread for each packet, which eliminates the risk of resource exhaustion. Alternatively, a thread pool can be implemented to limit the number of concurrent threads.
    method: UNKNOWN
