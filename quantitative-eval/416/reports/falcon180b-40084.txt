vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-40084 at lines 39-44 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a race condition occurring due to improper handling of the `client_socket` variable, shared between the main thread and the newly created thread.
where: Lines 39-44 in `falcon180b-40084`:
39: client_sockets[num_clients] = client_socket;
40: num_clients++;
41: pthread_t thread_id;
42: pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *)&client_socket);
why: If not resolved, this race condition may lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, and security risks as multiple threads access and modify the same `client_socket` variable concurrently.
how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by rapidly connecting multiple clients to the server, causing the server to modify shared variables in an unpredictable and unsafe manner.
code-sources: The `client_socket` variable defined at line 36 and used at line 43 is the primary entry point.
code-sinks: The `client_socket` variable is used in handling client data within the `handle_client` function, specifically at lines 12-29.

 ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves dynamically allocating memory for the client socket pointer inside the main loop before passing it to the thread creation function. This prevents a race condition since each thread gets its dedicated memory space, ensuring `client_socket` values are handled independently.
