vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-628.c (severity: High)
what: The code creates a race condition because the `client_socket` variable in `accept_connections` is shared by multiple threads without synchronization.
where: Lines within the `accept_connections` function.
why: A race condition can result in undefined behavior where multiple threads may read and write shared data concurrently, leading to crashes or incorrect program behavior.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting clients, causing the `client_socket` variable to be overwritten or corrupted, which could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
code-sources: The entry point is at `accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &addr_size);` in the `accept_connections` function.
code-sinks: The action involving user input is the assignment `client_sockets[num_clients++] = client_socket;` within the `accept_connections` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The fix involves allocating memory for a new integer pointer `new_client_socket`, saving the accepted client socket in this pointer, and passing this pointer to the thread. This prevents the race condition on `client_socket` by ensuring each thread operates on its own copy of the client socket descriptor.
