 
vuln-fix: CWE-134: Uncontrolled Format String in falcon180b-47821, lines 12-17 (severity: High)
what: The code directly passes user-supplied input to the `printf` function, leading to a potential format string vulnerability.
where: The vulnerability resides in the file falcon180b-47821, specifically in the `handle_client` function, lines 24-25.

why: If not resolved, this weakness can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, read memory contents, or crash the application by leveraging format string specifiers.

how: An attacker can craft a specially formatted string as input to include format specifiers like `%x`, `%n`, etc. When this string is passed to `printf`, it causes the program to exhibit unintended behaviors, such as revealing memory contents or modifying memory locations.

code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function on line 22, which receives data from the network into the `buffer`.

code-sinks: The `printf` function on line 25 prints out the contents of `buffer` without any sanitization or validation.

suggested-fix:
```diff
24c24
<         printf("Received message: %s\n", buffer);
---
>         printf("Received message: %.1024s\n", buffer);
```

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed code change ensures that only a limited amount of user input (`buffer`) is printed, and treating it as a string (`%.1024s`). This prevents format string specifiers in the input data from being processed by `printf`.

method: UNKNOWN
