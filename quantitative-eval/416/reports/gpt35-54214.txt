vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-54214 (lines 6-68) (severity: High)
what: The code does not adequately manage buffer sizes when reading data from a client socket, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in `client_handler` function at line 48 in the file gpt35-54214.
why: A buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption, compromising the system's security and stability.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message larger than the buffer size (1024 bytes) to the server, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially execute malicious code or disrupt the service.
code-sources: `read(socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer))` in `client_handler` function.
code-sinks: `printf("Received message from client[%d]: %s\n", socket, buffer);` and `write(socket, buffer, strlen(buffer));` in `client_handler` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The fix changes the `write` function to use the actual number of bytes read (`bytes_read`) instead of `strlen(buffer)`, preventing potential buffer overflow. Additionally, it adds a check to warn if the buffer size limit is reached, indicating that the incoming message was too large.
method: UNKNOWN
