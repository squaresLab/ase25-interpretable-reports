vuln-fix: Command Injection (CWE-78) in gpt35-40404 at lines 59-69, 71-77 (severity: High)
what: The application executes system commands without proper validation or sanitization, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
where: Lines 59-69 and 71-77 in file gpt35-40404:
 - At line 59: `system(buffer + 9);` 
 - At line 71: `FILE *fp = popen(buffer + 12, "r");`
why: If this vulnerability is not fixed, an attacker can execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the server.
how: An attacker would send a specially crafted message prefixed with "N3TCL13NT" or "3X1TFUNCT10N". These prefixes allow the attacker to inject commands directly into the system's command line through `system()` or `popen()`.
code-sources: The `read()` function at line 51 reads user input from the socket into the `buffer`.
code-sinks: The unsafe calls to `system(buffer + 9)` at line 59 and `popen(buffer + 12, "r")` at line 71 execute commands crafted by the attacker.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix replaces the calls to `system()` and `popen()` with error messages logged to `stderr`. It avoids executing any command passed by the user, preventing command injection.
