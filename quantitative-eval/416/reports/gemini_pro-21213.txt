vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gemini_pro-21213, lines 72-75 (severity: High)
what: The buffer used to read data from the socket can overflow if the input exceeds the allocated size of the buffer, leading to a potential crash or execution of arbitrary code.
where: Lines 72-75 in gemini_pro-21213
why: If this buffer overflow is not resolved, an attacker may execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing the service.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted payload that exceeds the buffer size, causing a buffer overflow.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the socket read operation at line 72 (`read(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer))`).
code-sinks: The user input read from the socket is used in `strtok(buffer, " ")` and other subsequent functions without proper validation.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
72c72,74
<     int n = read(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
---
>     int n = recv(sockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0);
>     if (n >= sizeof(buffer)) {
>         fprintf(stderr, "Input too large\n");
>         close(sockfd);
>         pthread_exit(NULL);
>     }
>     buffer[n] = '\0';
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff changes the `read` function to `recv` and ensures that the buffer is null-terminated by bounding the read size to `sizeof(buffer) - 1` and appending a null character to ensure safety. Additionally, it checks the return value of `recv`, and if the received data size exceeds the buffer size, it closes the socket and exits the thread, preventing any buffer overflow.
