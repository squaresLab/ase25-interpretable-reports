vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in falcon180b-28077 at lines 23 and 36-40 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability due to the concurrent use of the `client_socket` variable without proper synchronization mechanisms.
where: falcon180b-28077 at lines 23 and 36-40
why: An attacker could exploit this race condition to cause undefined behavior, including server crashes or data corruption, leading to potential denial-of-service conditions or other unintended consequences.
how: An attacker would need to rapidly connect and disconnect from the server, potentially processing messages out of order or causing multiple threads to operate on the same `client_socket`, resulting in concurrency issues.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is at line 23 within the `handle_client` function where the `recv` function is called.
code-sinks: Actions performed using user input occur at lines 25 and 27 where `printf` and `send` functions are called respectively to process and echo back the client's message.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: Introducing a mutex lock around the `accept` call ensures that only one thread can accept a new client connection at a time, thus preventing multiple threads from manipulating the same `client_socket` simultaneously. Additionally, dynamically allocating memory for `client_socket` ensures each thread has its own copy, eliminating concurrent access issues.
