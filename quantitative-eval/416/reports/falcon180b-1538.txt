    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in falcon180b-1538 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code has a race condition due to improper handling and synchronization of the `client_sock` variable passed to `pthread_create`.
    where: 
    - Vulnerability lines: entire `handle_client` function, and lines 64-68 in the `main` function where `pthread_create` is called.
    - File: falcon180b-1538
    why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that multiple threads could potentially overwrite each otherâ€™s `client_sock` value, leading to incorrect client handling, potential data leaks, or unexpected program crashes.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating multiple connections at nearly the same time, creating a scenario where the `client_sock` variable has not been properly synchronized across threads, leading to race conditions and improper handling of client sockets.
    code-sources: The `accept` function at line 54 accepts user connections, providing an entry point for user input when creating new client sockets.
    code-sinks: The `client_sock` values are used in the `pthread_create` function on line 68 to create new threads to handle client communication, and in the `recv` function in `handle_client`, where data from clients is read.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by dynamically allocating memory for each client socket, ensuring that each thread has its own unique copy of `client_sock` to work with. This prevents the race condition caused by passing the same `client_sock` variable to multiple threads. The `pthread_detach` call ensures thread resources are cleaned up, and the pointer is freed to prevent memory leaks.
    method: UNKNOWN
