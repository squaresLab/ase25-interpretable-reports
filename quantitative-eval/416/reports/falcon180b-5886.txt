    vuln-fix: CWE-665 (Improper Initialization) and CWE-780 (Use of Incorrectly-Resolved Name or Reference) in falcon180b-5886 at `handle_client` function (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of sockets where multiple threads access the same global variables (`clients` and `num_clients`) without proper synchronization, leading to race conditions. Additionally, there is a risk of buffer overflow in the `recv` call and improper termination of threads due to direct socket closure.
    where: The vulnerability is located in `falcon180b-5886` on the following lines:
    - Lines 30 to 46 within the `handle_client` function.
    - Lines 65 to 72 within the `main` function.
    why: If unresolved, these vulnerabilities can lead to several severe consequences, including data corruption, crashes, and potential remote code execution due to buffer overflow or race conditions.
    how: An attacker could exploit the race condition by sending multiple simultaneous requests, causing unpredictable behavior in the global state. Buffer overflow could allow an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    code-sources: 
    - Entry point: `recv` call on line 34, receiving user input.
    code-sinks: 
    - Actions: `send` calls on lines 41 and 52, which use user-provided data to send messages to other clients.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff includes the following changes:
    - Buffer bounds are checked in the `recv` function to prevent buffer overflow.
    - Added mutex locks around accesses to `clients` and `num_clients` to avoid race conditions.
    - Ensures that the `buffer` is null-terminated to prevent unexpected behavior.
    - Introduces storage for thread IDs and a cleanup function to handle thread cancellation upon server shutdown, preventing resource leakage.
