    vuln-fix: Race Condition in gemini_pro-31620 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a race condition caused by incorrect handling of thread arguments. The same memory location (&i) is passed to multiple threads without synchronization, leading to threads potentially receiving and operating on incorrect values of `i`.
    where: The race condition occurs in the `main` function when creating player threads.
    why: Failure to resolve this weakness can result in threads operating on incorrect or inconsistent data, leading to logical errors that can cause the application to behave unpredictably, and potentially even produce incorrect results or crash.
    how: An attacker can exploit this race condition by manipulating the timing of thread execution (e.g., via heavy system load or other means), potentially causing threads to read incorrect player IDs.
    code-sources: The initial integer `i` in the for loop within the `main` function.
    code-sinks: The parameter passed to `pthread_create`, specifically `&i` in the `main` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix involves creating an array `player_ids` to store unique player IDs. Each thread is then passed a different address from this array, ensuring that threads do not interfere with one another by sharing a single memory location.
