vuln-fix: Concurrent Access to Shared Resource (CWE-362) and Improper Synchronization (CWE-662) in falcon180b-35438 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability arises from multiple threads concurrently accessing and modifying the shared resource `clients` and `num_clients` without any synchronization mechanisms.
where: In the `main` function on line 28 when `num_clients` is incremented and in the global `clients` array on the same line.
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is data corruption and inconsistent state, which can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple concurrent connections, which leads to race conditions and potential overwriting or mismanagement of client socket descriptors.
code-sources: 
- `int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);`
- `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`

code-sinks: 
- `send(client_socket, buffer, bytes_received, 0);`
- `clients[num_clients++] = client_socket;`

    }

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes introduce a mutex `clients_mutex` to protect access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By locking this mutex before modifying these shared resources and unlocking it afterwards, the changes ensure proper synchronization and prevent race conditions.
