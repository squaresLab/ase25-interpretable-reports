    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-64451 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability due to the incorrect handling of thread arguments in the `create_thread` function.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `create_thread` function, where the `id` argument is shared among all threads without proper synchronization.
    why: If not resolved, this race condition can lead to undefined behavior or program crashes, causing potential data corruption and security risks.
    how: An attacker could exploit this race condition to manipulate data being processed by different threads, leading to unexpected results or making the application crash.
    code-sources: In this program, there are no user inputs as sources. However, the vulnerability arises from the shared `id` variable in the `create_thread` function.
    code-sinks: The sink is the improper usage of the `id` variable inside the `create_thread` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix allocates memory for a new integer to hold the thread id and then passes this pointer to the `worker` function. This ensures each thread receives a unique copy of the `id`, preventing the race condition. Freeing the allocated memory ensures no memory leaks in the `create_thread` function.
    method: UNKNOWN
