vuln-fix: CWE-665: Improper Initialization in falcon180b-50361 (severity: High)
what: The code contains an improper initialization vulnerability where client_socket is not being correctly handled across multiple threads.
where: Lines 7, 11, 14, 22, 44 in falcon180b-50361
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it can lead to race conditions and undefined behavior, potentially allowing attackers to crash the server or hijack sessions.
how: An attacker could exploit this by attempting to connect and disconnect multiple times rapidly, causing one thread to close a socket while another thread is trying to use the same socket, leading to undefined behavior.
code-sources: `Accept` function call on line 44, which accepts incoming client connections and stores them in `client_socket`.
code-sinks: `Send` function call on line 20 and `Recv` function call on line 16, which both use `client_socket` for network communication.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix ensures that each thread receives a unique pointer to its own copy of `client_socket`. This change prevents the race condition that would arise from multiple threads sharing the same `client_socket` variable.
