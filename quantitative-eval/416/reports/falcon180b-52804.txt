    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-52804 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability lies in the handling of user-supplied data within the `handle_client` function. Specifically, the `send` function is called with a buffer whose length is determined by `strlen(buffer)`, which can lead to a buffer overflow if the input size exceeds the allocated buffer size of `BUFFER_SIZE`.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, particularly the line `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`.
    why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker could exploit this buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the server, lead to a denial of service, or corrupt memory, which can compromise the integrity and availability of the server.
    how: An attacker would send a specially crafted message that exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`. This oversized message can cause the application to write beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer when it is sent to other clients, potentially overwriting critical memory regions.
    code-sources: The entry point in the code where user input enters the application is the `recv` function call within `handle_client`, specifically the line: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`.
    code-sinks: The action performed by the application using user input from a source is the `send` function call within `handle_client`, specifically the line: `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that the exact number of bytes received (`bytes_received`) is sent to other clients, rather than using `strlen(buffer)`, which might not correctly represent the size of the received data. Additionally, safeguards ensure that only initialized client sockets are included in the loop and properly handle the removal of a client socket from the clients array.
    method: UNKNOWN
