 
    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-13301 at handle_client function (severity: high)
    what: The vulnerability occurs due to a potential buffer overflow in the `buffer` array used to store client messages. The buffer size is fixed at 1024 bytes. If a client sends a message exceeding this size, it can overflow the buffer, leading to potentially exploitable conditions such as overwriting adjacent memory.
    where: In the file falcon180b-13301, within the `handle_client` function:
    ```c
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    while (1) {
        memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            break;
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    why: If not resolved, a buffer overflow can result in several critical issues including remote code execution, program crashes, and compromising the system's security integrity.
    how: An attacker would send a payload exceeding 1024 bytes to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability. If successfully executed, this could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash the application.
    code-sources: The source of user input is the `recv` function:
    ```c
    int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
    ```
    code-sinks: The vulnerable sink is the direct use of the received data in the `buffer` array without adequate boundary checks.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fixes the vulnerability by ensuring the buffer has an additional slot for a null terminator and checking the return value of `recv` for errors. This prevents overflow by guaranteeing the string is valid and safely null-terminated, thus preserving memory integrity and mitigating the buffer overflow risk.
    method: UNKNOWN
