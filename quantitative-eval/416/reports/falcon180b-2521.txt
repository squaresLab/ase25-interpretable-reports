 
    vuln-fix: OS Command Injection (CWE-78) in falcon180b-2521 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is due to the use of the `system` function with user input that is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function, specifically at the line `system("clear");`.
    why: Failing to resolve this issue could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands, potentially leading to data loss, unauthorized access, or system compromise.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious system commands if they can control the input that is passed to the `system` function.
    code-sources: `scanf("%d", &choice);`, `scanf(" %c", &answer);`
    code-sinks: `system("clear");`

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff replaces the unconditional use of `system("clear")` with a safe, multi-platform method using preprocessor directives to ensure the correct system command is used based on the operating system. While this does not eliminate the risk of command injection, it provides a controlled and appropriate usage context.
    method: UNKNOWN
