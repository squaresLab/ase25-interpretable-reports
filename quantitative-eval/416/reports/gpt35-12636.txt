    vuln-fix: CWE-366: TOCTOU (Time-of-check Time-of-use) Race Condition in gpt35-12636 at lines 12-20 (severity: Medium)
    what: The vulnerability is a race condition due to passing the address of the loop variable `i` to the thread function. Since all threads share this variable, they may read its value at different times, leading to unpredictable behavior.
    where: 
        - Relevant lines: 12-20 in the function main
        - File: gpt35-12636
    why: If the index values are corrupted, the threads may not perform their intended operations correctly, possibly leading to data corruption or program crashes.
    how: An attacker might exploit this by influencing the timing of thread execution to cause threads to receive incorrect index values, leading to unpredictable behavior.
    code-sources: Line 17 where `&i` is passed to `pthread_create` as `arg` (thread creation).
    code-sinks: Entire `thread_function`, especially where `index` is used.

```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change moves the thread argument outside of the immediate scope of the loop by introducing an array `thread_args`. Each element of this array is passed to the respective thread, ensuring that each thread gets a consistent and unique value of `i`. This avoids the race condition by eliminating shared access to the loop variable.
    method: UNKNOWN
