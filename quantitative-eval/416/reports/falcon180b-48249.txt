vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-48249, handle_client function, at lines 16-22 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow within the `handle_client` function. Specifically, the use of `recv` to read data into the `buffer` without proper bounds checking can lead to an overflow if the received message exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function between lines 16-22 of the falcon180b-48249 file.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or a crash of the application, making it susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a message that exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE` bytes, causing memory adjacent to the buffer to be overwritten. This can subsequently alter the program flow and potentially allow execution of malicious code.
code-sources: The entry point for user input in the code is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The application performs actions using the user input by printing it with `printf` and echoing it back to the client with `send`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer is always null-terminated by subtracting one from `BUFFER_SIZE` in the `recv` call and explicitly setting the last character to the null terminator. This prevents accidental reads beyond the buffer size, thus avoiding buffer overflow issues.
