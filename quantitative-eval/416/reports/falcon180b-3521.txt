vuln-fix: Use of Uninitialized Variable (CWE-457) in falcon180b-3521 (severity: High)
what: The variable `server_socket` is used in various socket operations before it is initialized, leading to undefined behavior.
where: The uninitialized use occurs in the `main` function in falcon180b-3521.
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that the server may crash or behave unpredictably, creating a potential denial of service situation or an exploitable condition for attackers.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending connections to the server, causing it to exhibit unpredictable behavior or crash, potentially opening up further vectors for attack if the crash leaves the server in an insecure state.
code-sources: The source is the lack of initialization of `server_socket`.
code-sinks: Actions like `setsockopt`, `bind`, and `listen` that use the `server_socket` without it being initialized.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff fixes the vulnerability by ensuring that `server_socket` is properly initialized as a socket using the `socket()` function before it is used in other socket operations. This prevents undefined behavior due to the use of an uninitialized variable.
method: UNKNOWN
