vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-29224 at lines 15-26 (severity: High)
what: The code potentially allows for a buffer overflow when receiving data from a client due to lack of input validation on the length of data received. The buffer is fixed at BUFFER_SIZE, but there is no check to ensure received data does not exceed this size.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at lines 15-26 in the file falcon180b-29224.
why: If an attacker is able to send data larger than BUFFER_SIZE, it can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or corruption of the process's memory space.
how: An attacker could connect to the server and send a payload larger than 1024 bytes, thereby overflowing the buffer and overwriting adjacent memory on the stack, which could lead to the execution of malicious code or a denial of service.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the client's data sent over the socket, received by the `recv` call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The output is performed by the `printf` function which prints the received buffer.

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed code change limits the amount of data read into the buffer by using `BUFFER_SIZE - 1`, and explicitly ensuring the buffer is null-terminated by setting `buffer[BUFFER_SIZE - 1]` to `'\0'`, preventing potential overflow. This ensures that the buffer will not overflow even if `recv` attempts to receive more data than expected.
