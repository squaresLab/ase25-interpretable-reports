vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-33373 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition due to the `task_id` variable being shared between the main thread and the newly created threads, which can lead to undefined behavior.
where: The vulnerability is in the `add_task()` function, specifically at the lines where `task_id` is set after the mutex is released and then used in `pthread_create`.
why: If not resolved, this can lead to incorrect task creation, overlap of task IDs, and potential crashes of the application due to unexpected behavior in the thread execution.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing multiple tasks to be added simultaneously, potentially leading to race conditions where multiple threads access and modify the same variable.
code-sources: User input is not directly involved in this case as tasks are being added programmatically in `main()`.
code-sinks: Actions performed using the `task_id` in `task_func` function.

```diff
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

// Global variable to keep track of the number of tasks
int num_tasks = 0;

// Mutex for thread-safe access to the num_tasks variable
pthread_mutex_t num_tasks_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

// Function to create a new task
void* task_func(void* arg) {
    int task_id = *(int*) arg;
    printf("Starting task %d\n", task_id);
    sleep(1);
    printf("Finished task %d\n", task_id);
    return NULL;
}

// Function to add a new task to the scheduler
void add_task() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&num_tasks_mutex);
    num_tasks++;
    int task_id = num_tasks;  // Capture the task_id while holding the mutex
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&num_tasks_mutex);

    pthread_t thread_id;
    // Allocate memory for task_id argument
    int *task_id_ptr = malloc(sizeof(int));
    *task_id_ptr = task_id;
    pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, task_func, task_id_ptr); 
    printf("Added task %d\n", task_id);
}

// Function to remove a task from the scheduler
void remove_task(int task_id) {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&num_tasks_mutex);
    num_tasks--;
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&num_tasks_mutex);

    printf("Removed task %d\n", task_id);
}

// Function to print the current state of the scheduler
void print_state() {
    pthread_mutex_lock(&num_tasks_mutex);
    printf("Current number of tasks: %d\n", num_tasks);
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&num_tasks_mutex);
}

int main() {
    add_task();
    add_task();
    add_task();

    sleep(2);

    remove_task(1);

    print_state();

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix captures the `task_id` while holding the mutex, ensuring that each task gets a unique ID without interference from other threads. By passing a dynamically allocated memory containing `task_id` to the thread, it ensures each thread operates on its own copy, avoiding shared state issues.
