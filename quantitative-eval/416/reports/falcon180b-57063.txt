    vuln-fix: Improper Handling of Boundaries (CWE-119) and Use of Potentially Dangerous Function without Checking Critera (CWE-134) in falcon180b-57063 (severity: High)
    what: The code has multiple vulnerabilities. The `recv` function and `send` function arenâ€™t adequately checked for buffer limits, which can lead to buffer overflows. Additionally, the use of `printf` without format string specified can lead to format string vulnerabilities.
    where: The vulnerabilities are located in the function `handle_client` in lines regarding `recv`, `send`, and `printf` calls.
    why: Not resolving these weaknesses can lead to severe consequences such as arbitrary code execution, denial of service, and information leaks. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to crash the server or execute malicious code.
    how: An attacker can send specially crafted input to exploit the buffer overflow or format string vulnerability. By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    code-sources: The `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function is the entry point where user input enters the application.
    code-sinks: The `send` and `printf` function calls utilize user input in potentially insecure ways.

    ```

    explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff null terminates the received buffer to prevent overflow, checks the return value of `send` to handle errors, and locks the client list during modifications to avoid race conditions. Additionally, threads are detached to manage thread resources properly.
