    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-56980 (severity: High)
    what: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because the `recv()` function receives data into the `buffer` without checking if the received number of bytes exceeds the size of the buffer. This can result in writing past the end of the buffer.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at the call to `recv()` on line 14 of file falcon180b-56980.
    why: An attacker who exploits this vulnerability could cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, compromising its integrity and the data it holds.
    how: An attacker would send a specially crafted message larger than 1024 bytes to the server. This message would overflow the `buffer`, potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite adjacent memory and inject malicious code.
    code-sources: Entry point for user input is the `recv` function call on line 14 in the `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: Actions performed using user input include comparing commands and taking actions such as setting temperature, turning lights on/off, or exiting the thread.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff ensures that the `recv` call will not cause a buffer overflow by reducing the amount of bytes it can receive by one (`BUF_SIZE - 1`). This is because `recv` will ensure that there is space for the null terminator, preventing buffer overflow. Additionally, in the case where `bytes_received` is zero, it indicates that the client has performed an orderly shutdown, and the socket should be closed and thread exited.
