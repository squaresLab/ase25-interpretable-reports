    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-18286 (severity: High)
    what: The application receives data using `recv` into a fixed-size buffer `buffer` of size `BUF_SIZE` (1024), but does not properly check for the size of the data written into the buffer. If the data received is larger than `BUF_SIZE`, it leads to a buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability exists at line 20 in function `handle_client`.
    why: A successful buffer overflow attack can lead to various harmful outcomes, including overwriting critical data, crashing the program, or executing arbitrary code, potentially leading to unauthorized system access.
    how: An attacker can send more than 1024 bytes of data to the server in a single message. This will cause a buffer overflow, as the `buffer` array in `handle_client` can hold only up to 1024 bytes. The overflow can overwrite adjacent memory locations, possibly allowing the attacker to take control of the execution flow.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input occurs at line 7 in `main` when `recv` is called.
    code-sinks: The application processes the received data within the `handle_client` function, specifically at the `recv` and `send` function calls.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix ensures that the buffer is null-terminated to prevent overlapping memory access. By adding `buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';`, any excess bytes beyond the buffer size are effectively ignored, preventing overflow. Adding a length check ensures that only valid data up to the buffer size is processed.
    method: UNKNOWN
