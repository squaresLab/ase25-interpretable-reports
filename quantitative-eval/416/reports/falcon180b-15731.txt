vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-15731 at lines 17, 25, 29, 33, and 45 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a potential buffer overflow in the handling of client messages within the `handle_client` function. The fixed-size buffer `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` can be overflowed if a client sends more than `BUFFER_SIZE` bytes, leading to undefined behavior or possible execution of malicious code.
where: The vulnerability exists at multiple locations in the `handle_client` function in falcon180b-15731:
- Line 17: Definition of `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]`.
- Line 25: `recv` function call which writes data into `buffer`.
- Line 29: Printing of the `buffer` to the console.
- Line 33: Sending the `buffer` to other clients.
- Line 45: Accepting client connections without bounds checking.
why: If this buffer overflow is not resolved, it could lead to an attacker being able to overwrite critical memory regions, potentially executing arbitrary code, crashing the server, or corrupting data.
how: An attacker can send a maliciously crafted message longer than `BUFFER_SIZE` bytes to overflow the buffer, which could overwrite adjacent memory (stack buffer overflow) and lead to code execution or other malicious activities.
code-sources: The source of user input originates from the `recv` function call at line 25 within the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The application uses the unchecked buffer in the `printf` function call at line 29 and the `send` function call at line 33.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the `recv` call does not cause a buffer overflow by only accepting up to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes and ensures null termination of the buffer using `buffer[BUFFER_SIZE - 1] = '\0'`. It also corrects the management of `client_socket` by allocating memory for it to avoid race conditions caused by the reused socket file descriptor.
