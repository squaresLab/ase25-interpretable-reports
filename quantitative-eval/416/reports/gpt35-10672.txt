vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in gpt35-10672 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability when processing client messages.
where: Specifically, in the function `connection_handler` at the line where `client_message[read_size] = '\0';` is set.
why: An attacker could send a message that exactly fills the buffer, causing an additional null terminator to be written out of bounds, potentially leading to memory corruption, crashes, or further exploitation.
how: An attacker would send a message of exactly 2000 bytes. When the server attempts to null-terminate the buffer, it would write one byte beyond the allocated space for `client_message`, corrupting adjacent memory.
code-sources: User input is received at `recv(client_socket, client_message, 2000, 0)` in the `connection_handler` function.
code-sinks: User input is used directly at `printf("Client message: %s", client_message);` and `write(client_socket, client_message, strlen(client_message));` in the `connection_handler` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: This fix ensures that the buffer is only null-terminated within its bounds. If the received message exactly fills the buffer, it sets the last character of the buffer to null terminator, preventing an out-of-bounds write.
method: UNKNOWN
