vuln-fix: CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-4575 lines 16-26 and 32-37 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability occurs due to the use of `strcat` for constructing HTTP responses without proper bounds checking, leading to a potential heap-based buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in `handle_client` function in lines 16-26 and also in lines 32-37.
why: Failure to resolve this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, crash the application, or cause other unexpected behavior by overflowing the buffer.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted input to trigger the heap-based buffer overflow, overwriting memory beyond the allocated buffer.
code-sources: The entry point in code where user input enters the application is the `recv` function at line 18.
code-sinks: The vulnerable actions are performed when `strcat` appends data to the `response` buffer at lines 24-26.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
34a35,36
>     memset(response, 0, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE); // Clear the buffer to avoid unintended data
36a39,44
>     if (bytes_received <= 0) {
>         break;
>     }
>     response[0] = '\0'; // Initialize response to an empty string
>     int response_length = snprintf(response, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n<html><body><h1>Hello, World!</h1></body></html>");
>     if (response_length >= MAX_REQUEST_SIZE) {
>         // Handle error: response size exceeded buffer size
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by using `snprintf` instead of `strcat` to ensure that the buffer size is respected and prevent any overflow that could occur with `strcat`. Additionally, it initializes the response buffer to an empty string and checks the length of the generated response to ensure it does not exceed the allocated buffer size.
method: UNKNOWN
