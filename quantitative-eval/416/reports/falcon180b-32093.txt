vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-32093 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is due to the usage of `recv` in the `handle_client` function without proper bounds checking. The buffer is defined as `char buffer[1024];`, but there's no verification that `bytes_received` does not exceed the buffer's size, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
where: 
   - `falcon180b-32093`: 
      - Line 13: `char buffer[1024];`
      - Line 17: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);`
why: A buffer overflow can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, data corruption, and arbitrary code execution, which can be exploited to compromise the server.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending more than 1024 bytes of data to the server, which will overflow the `buffer` and potentially overwrite adjacent memory, leading to control over the program flow and execution.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix modifies the `recv` function to ensure that it reads at most `sizeof(buffer) - 1` bytes and then sets the last byte of the buffer to `'\0'` to null-terminate the string. This ensures that the buffer will not overflow and remain a valid null-terminated string.
method: UNKNOWN
