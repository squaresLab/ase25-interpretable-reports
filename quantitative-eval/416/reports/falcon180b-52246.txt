    
vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-52246 (severity: High)
    what: The issue in the given code is a potential race condition in the handling of client connections. Access to the `clients` array and the `max_clients` counter are not synchronized across multiple threads, which can lead to inconsistent state or segmentation faults if multiple threads modify these variables simultaneously.
    where: The vulnerability lies in the main function's loop (lines 47-59) and the handle_client function (lines 13-35).
    why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that it could crash the server due to invalid memory access or allow for denial-of-service attacks where the server becomes unresponsive due to inconsistent data.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing numerous clients to connect and disconnect rapidly. This could lead to race conditions as multiple threads update and access shared data structures (`clients` array and `max_clients`), causing the server to crash or behave unpredictably.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call within the `handle_client` function (line 17).
    code-sinks: The application performs actions using user input when it calls `send` within the for loop in the `handle_client` function (lines 23-25).

```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff includes the use of a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to synchronize access to the `clients` array and `max_clients` variable. This ensures that only one thread can modify these shared resources at a time, preventing race conditions and ensuring consistent state. The mutex is locked before and unlocked after any operation that accesses or modifies these shared resources.
