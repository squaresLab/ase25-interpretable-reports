 
    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-41977 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability in the given code is a race condition due to the use of a shared variable `customer_id` that is accessed by multiple threads without proper synchronization. 
    where: The race condition is located in the main function where it creates and starts multiple threads in falcon180b-41977, particularly lines around thread creation `pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, customer, &customer_id);` and subsequent method calls.
    why: If unresolved, this race condition could lead to inconsistent or incorrect behavior, as different threads may read and modify shared data simultaneously, leading to data corruption, unpredictable outputs, and potential program crashes.
    how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by triggering concurrent execution of threads in such a way that the shared variable `customer_id` is read and written simultaneously by multiple threads. This would cause erratic or unintended behavior in the application.
    code-sources: The entry point is the creation of customer, cook, waiter, and billing threads in the main function.
    code-sinks: The actions using user input (shared variable `customer_id`) are the calls to customer, cook, waiter, and billing functions passing the address of `customer_id`.

}
```
    explanation-suggested-fix: By using an array of customer IDs `customer_ids[NUM_THREADS]` and passing individual IDs to each thread, we ensure that each thread receives a unique ID without interference from other threads. This avoids the shared variable `customer_id` being simultaneously accessed by multiple threads, thus preventing the race condition.
