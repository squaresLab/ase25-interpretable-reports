    vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-19638 (severity: High)
    what: The code is vulnerable to a race condition because multiple threads can simultaneously access and modify shared account data without synchronization.
    where: The race condition vulnerability is located in the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions in the file `falcon180b-19638`. The vulnerable lines of code are where the account's balance is modified:
    - Line 21: `account->balance += 100.00;`
    - Line 30: `account->balance -= 100.00;`
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it can lead to inconsistent or incorrect account balances, potentially resulting in financial discrepancies or data corruption.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple threads to deposit and withdraw money concurrently, causing the account balance to become inconsistent due to unsynchronized access and modification.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the random `account_id` generated in the `main` function (Line 42).
    code-sinks: The actions performed using user input occur in the `deposit` and `withdraw` functions which modify the account balances (Lines 21 and 30, respectively).

    }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a `pthread_mutex_t` lock for each `Account` structure. Before modifying the account balance, each thread locks the associated account's mutex to ensure exclusive access. After making the modification, the thread unlocks the mutex. This prevents race conditions by ensuring that only one thread at a time can modify an account's balance.
