vuln-fix: Unbounded Write Vulnerability (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gpt35-16205 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to unbounded write operations in the `handle_client` function. The `buffer` array is used to store data received from clients without checking the length of the received data, leading to potential overflow.
where: The vulnerability occurs in the function `handle_client` on line 44 in the file `gpt35-16205`.
why: Not resolving this buffer overflow vulnerability may allow attackers to overwrite critical memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a message that exceeds the buffer size (`BUFFER_SIZE`) to the server, which will cause the buffer to overflow, leading to possible arbitrary code execution or a denial-of-service condition.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is in the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The user input is handled in the `buffer` array and subsequently used in the `send_message_to_clients` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix ensures that the receiver buffer's null-terminator is added to prevent reading past the buffer's end. Additionally, it introduces a safer `snprintf` function for formatting the client message, which includes size-boundaries to prevent buffer overflow.
