    vuln-fix: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release in gemini_pro-8939 (severity: high)
    what: The vulnerabilities are due to missing the proper release of resources in multi-threaded environments.
    where: The vulnerability can be located in `gemini_pro-8939` file within the `handle_client` function and in the main loop at the following lines:
    - `pthread_create(&thread, NULL, handle_client, (void *)&client_sock)` (line 67)
    - `close(client_sock)` (line 24 of `handle_client` function)
    why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that it may result in resource leaks and eventually application crashes or denial of service due to resource exhaustion.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple connections to the server, causing it to run out of resources (such as file descriptors), thereby disrupting service for legitimate users.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the socket connection accepted in the main loop using `accept`.
    code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input are receiving GPS data with `recv` and sending back a confirmation with `send`.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces proper resource management by adding code to release resources in case of error conditions. Specifically:
    - Allocating memory for a copy of the client socket descriptor to ensure each thread handles a different client.
    - Ensuring the client socket is closed if memory allocation for the client socket copy fails.
    - Freeing the allocated memory for the client socket copy if thread creation fails.
    method: UNKNOWN
