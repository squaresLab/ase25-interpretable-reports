vuln-fix: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) in falcon180b-6175 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly handle user input, leading to potential command injection vulnerabilities. Specifically, the command parsing function (`parse_command`) directly uses user input to construct command arguments without sanitization.
where: Lines 39-54 in falcon180b-6175
why: This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privilege level of the executing process, leading to potential system compromise.
how: An attacker could craft input that injects additional commands or alters the behavior of the intended command. For example, input like `ls; rm -rf /` could delete all files in the root directory if executed with sufficient privileges.
code-sources: The `fgets` function in the `main` function (line 71) where user input is read from stdin.
code-sinks: The `execvp` function in the `execute_command` function (line 22) where the user-provided command is executed.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff removes the trailing newline character from the user input. This provides minimal sanitization to prevent newline character issues in command injection. Further input validation and escaping should be implemented to ensure complete protection against command injections.
