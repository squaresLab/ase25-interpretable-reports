    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-4177 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, where data that is input by the client is not properly validated before being stored in a buffer. Specifically, the buffer `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` in the `handle_client` function can be overflowed if more than `BUFFER_SIZE` bytes are received.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function in the file falcon180b-4177, mainly around line numbers where `recv` and `printf` are used to handle and print incoming data from clients.
    why: If this buffer overflow is exploited, it could lead to various consequences such as application crashes, execution of arbitrary code, or compromise of sensitive information.
    how: An attacker can send a payload larger than 1024 bytes to overflow the buffer `buffer`, potentially gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server or crash the server, leading to a denial of service.
    code-sources: The entry point where user input enters is through the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: The output or usage of the user-provided data happens at both the `printf` function and the `send` function within the `handle_client` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested changes ensure that the `recv` function does not write beyond the bounds of the buffer by receiving a maximum of `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes and always null-terminating the string. Additionally, instead of using `strlen(buffer)` when sending data, the actual number of bytes received (`bytes_received`) is used, maintaining correct message length.
    method: UNKNOWN
