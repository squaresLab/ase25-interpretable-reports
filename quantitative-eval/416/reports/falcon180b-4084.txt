vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-4084 (severity: High) 
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `recv` function due to the inadequate handling of received data.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in the use of `recv` at line 19.
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overflow the buffer and potentially execute arbitrary code, causing serious damage or unauthorized access to the system.
how: An attacker could send a payload larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` (1024 bytes) to overflow the buffer `buffer`, overwriting adjacent memory and potentially taking control of the server process.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function at line 19.
code-sinks: The data received in `buffer` is utilized directly in the `printf` and `send` functions, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
suggested-fix: 
```diff

<         int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
---
>         int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE - 1, 0);

<         printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);

>         buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';
>         printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);

<                 send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
---
>                 send(client_sockets[i], buffer, bytes_received, 0);
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff reduces the buffer size used by `recv` to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1`, ensuring that there is always space for a null-terminator, which is crucial for safely handling strings in C. This change prevents buffer overflow. Additionally, it explicitly null-terminates the buffer after `recv` to ensure the data is properly handled as a string with safe bounds.
