vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-51565 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that could be exploited when receiving data from the socket.
where: The vulnerability is located at line `recv(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the function `handle_client`.
why: If not resolved, the buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, system crashes, or other malicious activities.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message that exceeds the buffer size, causing a buffer overflow and potentially allowing the attacker to overwrite memory areas, control the flow of the program, or execute arbitrary code.
code-sources: The entry points in code where user input enters the application are the `recv(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` statement in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using this user input include logging the received message with `printf("Received message: %s\n", buffer);` and sending the message to other clients with `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by changing the `recv` function to ensure that it does not read more than `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes, leaving space for the null terminator and preventing a buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
