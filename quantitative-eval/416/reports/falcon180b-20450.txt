    vuln-fix: CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference in falcon180b-20450 (severity: High)
    what: The code accesses the `name` field of `clients[num_clients]` without validating if `num_clients` is within bounds, which may lead to a NULL pointer dereference or buffer overflow.
    where: Line 26 in `falcon180b-20450`
    why: If an attacker connects to the server, they could send data that leads to accessing invalid memory, causing the server to crash or, potentially, enabling further exploits.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by ensuring that `num_clients` is greater than or equal to `MAX_CLIENTS` when accessing `clients[num_clients]`.
    code-sources: `accept()` connection in the `main()` loop, line 58.
    code-sinks: Access to `clients[num_clients].name` in `handle_client` function, line 26.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a check to find the correct client index based on the socket descriptor, preventing the possibility of accessing an invalid client entry. This eliminates the risk of dereferencing a NULL pointer or accessing out-of-bound memory for `clients[num_clients].name`.
    method: UNKNOWN
