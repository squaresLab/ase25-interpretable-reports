vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-23394 at lines 61, 80 (severity: High)
what: The code reads user input into a fixed-size buffer using `fgets()` without properly handling the possibility of the buffer being overrun, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
where: 
    - gpt35-23394, Line 61: `fgets(buffer, BUFSIZE, stdin);`
    - gpt35-23394, Line 80: `recv(sockfd, buffer, BUFSIZE, 0);`
why: Buffer overflows can lead to various issues including data corruption, crashes, and the execution of arbitrary code by malicious actors, potentially compromising the entire system.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing input that's larger than the expected buffer size, which can overwrite adjacent memory and lead to undefined behavior, including code execution.
code-sources: `fgets(buffer, BUFSIZE, stdin);`
code-sinks: `send(sockfd, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`

         if(send(sockfd, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0) < 0) {

 ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested patch ensures that the input buffer is properly null-terminated and does not overflow. This is done by checking the length of the input and manually null-terminating it to ensure it does not exceed the buffer size limit.
