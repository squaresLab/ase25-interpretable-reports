    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization in gemini_pro-19533 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code contains a race condition due to the reuse of the loop index variable \`i\` as an argument to \`pthread_create\`. The variable \`i\` is shared across the created threads and since it continues to change during the lifetime of the loop, threads may not receive the intended candidate ID.
    where: 
    - Line(s): 34 in \`gemini_pro-19533\` (pthread_create(&thread_ids[i], NULL, cast_vote, &i))
    why: If not resolved, this race condition can cause multiple threads to increment the vote count for the wrong candidates, resulting in incorrect and unpredictable election results.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating concurrent votes, leading to race conditions that cause incorrect vote tallying, thus corrupting the integrity of the voting process.
    code-sources: Loop counter \`i\` in the \`main()\` function.
    code-sinks: Argument to \`pthread_create\` in the \`main()\` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change creates a separate array \`candidate_ids\` to ensure each thread receives a unique and immutable candidate ID. This prevents the race condition, ensuring all votes are correctly incremented for their respective candidates.
    method: UNKNOWN
