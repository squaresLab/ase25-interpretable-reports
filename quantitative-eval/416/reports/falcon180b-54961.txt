vuln-fix: CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) in falcon180b-54961 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) race condition in managing the `num_clients` and `clients` array. There is no synchronization mechanism (e.g., mutex) protecting these resources.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function and `handle_client` function of the `falcon180b-54961` file.
why: An attacker can exploit this race condition to cause inconsistent state management, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected behavior, such as allowing more clients than the specified maximum or causing data corruption among clients.
how: An attacker could exploit this by rapidly connecting and disconnecting clients, potentially causing race conditions in the `num_clients` counter and the `clients` array, leading to improper access and resource management.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The application performs actions using user input in the `send` function call within the loop in the `handle_client` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to protect the shared resource `clients` array and the `num_clients` variable. The use of `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` ensures that only one thread at a time can modify these shared resources, thus preventing the race condition.
