    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-16070 (severity: High)
    what: The buffer `buf` in the `handle_client` function is used to receive data from the client without proper bounds checking on the received data, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function in file falcon180b-16070 about line 13.
    why: An attacker could exploit this buffer overflow to corrupt memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending more data than `BUF_SIZE` to the server, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
    code-sources: The `recv` function call in `handle_client` function receives data from the client, making it a code source.
    code-sinks: The `buf` array in the `handle_client` function is used without proper bounds checking, making it a code sink.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff changes the `recv` function call to ensure that no more than `BUF_SIZE - 1` bytes are read into the `buf` array, leaving space for a null terminator. Additionally, it explicitly null-terminates the received data to prevent any buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
