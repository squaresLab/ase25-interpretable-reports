vuln-fix: Data Race (CWE-362) in falcon180b-12584 (severity: High)
what: The code exhibits a data race condition. Multiple threads access and modify shared variables (like the loop variable `i` in the execution function) without proper synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes.
where: The primary issue is in the `execute_threads` function, especially the loop that creates threads with `pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, execute_thread, (void*) &i);`. This is line number 82.
why: Failing to resolve this vulnerability can lead to unpredictable behavior such as incorrect thread execution order, wrong waiting times, turnaround calculations, or program crashes.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a scenario where threads are executed in an unexpected order, leading to a system crash or incorrect program output. This could potentially be used to cause a denial of service.
code-sources: The addition of threads via the `add_thread` function.
code-sinks: Execution of threads in the `execute_threads` function and printing the execution results in the `execute_thread` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The changes involve introducing a mutex lock (`pthread_mutex_t`) to guard critical sections where shared data is accessed and modified. This prevents race conditions by ensuring that only one thread at a time can execute these sections of code. Additionally, thread IDs are handled appropriately to avoid modification during thread execution.
