 
    vuln-fix: Use of potentially dangerous function `bzero` in falcon180b-20239 (severity: Medium)
    what: The use of `bzero` to clear buffers in this code can lead to stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities as it does not check the size of the buffer being zeroed.
    where: The `bzero(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE);` calls are located in `handle_client` function starting from line 17 and in the `main` function at line 31.
    why: An attacker could send a carefully crafted input that exploits the improper bounds handling, leading to stack overflow, application crashes, or arbitrary code execution.
    how: An attacker can send data that is larger than the expected `BUFFER_SIZE`. Without proper bounds checking, this could overwrite memory, potentially leading to execution of arbitrary code or crashing the application.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function in `handle_client` function, which receives data from connected clients.
    code-sinks: The actions performed using the data read by `recv` includes the `bzero` operation and the `send` operation within the `handle_client` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The `bzero` function is being replaced with `explicit_bzero`, which ensures that the buffer is securely zeroed. This function is specifically designed to avoid being optimized out by the compiler, improving security by actually clearing the buffer memory.
