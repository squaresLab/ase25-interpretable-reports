vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in falcon180b-3007 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a race condition caused by the concurrent modification of the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable without any synchronization mechanisms.
where: The vulnerability occurs in the `accept_connections` function and `handle_client` function in the file falcon180b-3007 between lines 20-27.
why: If this race condition is not resolved, it could lead to inconsistent state, application crashes, or even potential security breaches where a malicious client might exploit the lack of synchronization to cause denial of service or other unpredictable behavior.
how: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by connecting multiple clients simultaneously and flooding the server with requests, thereby triggering the race condition and causing the server to behave unpredictably.
code-sources: `accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);` in the `accept_connections` function (line 22)
code-sinks: `clients[num_clients++] = client_socket;` in the `accept_connections` function (line 26)

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex (pthread_mutex_t) to synchronize access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By locking the mutex before modifying these shared resources and unlocking it after the modification, we ensure that only one thread can modify these resources at a time, thus avoiding the race condition.
method: UNKNOWN
