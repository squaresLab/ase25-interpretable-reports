    vuln-fix: Data Race Vulnerability (CWE-362) in falcon180b-9826 (severity: High)
    what: The provided code suffers from a data race condition due to non-thread-safe access to `thread_data_t` structures when passing them to threads.
    where: Lines creating threads and passing `thread_data_t` data (Approximately lines 55-63) in falcon180b-9826.
    why: If not resolved, this can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes, corrupted logs, or erroneous writes, which are highly critical for any concurrent logging system.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by manipulating or flooding the system with log messages, potentially causing irregular behavior, crashes, or loss of data integrity.
    code-sources: The string "Hello world!" in the `log_event` function.
    code-sinks: The `fprintf` function call in the `log_to_file` function.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix resolves the data race condition by creating an array of `thread_data_t` structures, thus ensuring each thread has a dedicated structure. This way, the address passed to `pthread_create` remains valid for the lifetime of the thread, avoiding concurrent modifications.
