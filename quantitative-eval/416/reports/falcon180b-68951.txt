vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-68951 (severity: High)

what: The vulnerable code allows a race condition to occur when clients array and num_clients are accessed and modified by multiple threads without any synchronization mechanism.

where: The vulnerability is located in the functions `handle_client` and `accept_connections` in the `falcon180b-68951` file.

why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could potentially cause the server to crash, corrupt data, or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

how: An attacker could exploit this by rapidly connecting and disconnecting from the server, potentially causing `num_clients` to become inconsistent or creating a scenario where multiple threads try to modify `clients` array concurrently, leading to undefined behavior.

code-sources: The entry point where user input enters the application is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.

code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input are the `printf` function and the `send` function in the `handle_client` function.

```

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a mutex named `clients_mutex` to protect the shared resources, specifically the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By locking this mutex before accessing or modifying these shared resources and unlocking it afterwards, we prevent multiple threads from concurrently accessing and modifying these resources, thereby eliminating the race condition.

method: UNKNOWN
