vuln-fix: CWE-BUFFER-OVERFLOW in falcon180b-45869:20-24 (severity: High)
what: The code can potentially write outside the bounds of the buffer due to an incorrect use of `recv` without proper boundary checks, which may lead to buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at line numbers 20-24 in the file falcon180b-45869.
why: Failure to resolve this vulnerability can lead to severe consequences, including application crashes, data corruption, or potential code execution by an attacker.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload that exceeds the size of `BUFFER_SIZE`. This would cause `recv` to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service.
code-sources: The primary entry point for user input is the network socket connection accepted in the `main` function at line 45.
code-sinks: The vulnerable function is `recv` at line 20, which reads data from the socket into the buffer.

 ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix specifies `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` in the `recv` function to ensure that there is always space for the null terminator. This prevents the buffer overflow by ensuring that the buffer cannot be filled beyond its capacity.
