vuln-fix: Missing Bounds Check (CWE-119) in falcon180b-10236 on Lines `handle_client` function (severity: High)
what: The code does not validate the length of data received from the client (`recv`) before printing and sending it to other clients, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
where: Lines 20-33 in `falcon180b-10236`, function `handle_client`
why: Not resolving this weakness can allow an attacker to send a maliciously crafted message that overflows the buffer, leading to a potential crash or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending data larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` causing a buffer overflow, possibly leading to execution of arbitrary code, denial of service, or compromise of the underlying server.
code-sources: 
- The entry point of user input in the code is at Line 20 within the function `handle_client` where `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` is called.
code-sinks: 
- The user input is processed and then printed using `printf` on Line 25.
- It is also sent to other clients using the `send` function on Lines 28-30.

explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff ensures that the buffer is null-terminated to avoid buffer overflows. Additionally, by offsetting the `recv` to BUFFER_SIZE-1, it reserves space for the null terminator. The use of a dynamically allocated copy of `client_socket` passed to `pthread_create` prevents race conditions caused by the reuse of `client_socket` variable.
