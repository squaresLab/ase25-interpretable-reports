    vuln-fix: Function returning stack-allocated memory (CWE-562, CWE-825) in falcon180b-41495 lines 58-60 (severity: High)
    what: A function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory which is deallocated at the end of the function.
    where: Line 58-60 in the function get_process_name() in file falcon180b-41495.
    why: The caller may dereference a dangling pointer, which can lead to undefined behavior or a crash, potentially causing a Denial of Service (DoS).
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making repeated calls to this function, leading to dereferencing of invalid memory locations, resulting in a program crash.
    code-sources: Entry point is the 'get_process_info' function which calls the 'get_process_name' function.
    code-sinks: The return value of 'get_process_name' is directly used in 'strncpy(name, (char *)get_process_name(pid), MAX_PROCESS_NAME_LENGTH);'.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested diff modifies the get_process_name function to take a char *name argument, allowing the caller to allocate memory and pass a reference. This prevents returning a pointer to stack-allocated memory, avoiding the risk of dangling pointers. Additionally, it ensures the string is properly null-terminated.
    method: UNKNOWN
