vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-19816 (severity: High)
what: The given code is vulnerable to a race condition in the `encrypt_thread` function, where multiple threads simultaneously read and write to the `buffer` array without synchronization, potentially causing data corruption.
where: The vulnerability is located in the function `encrypt_thread` in file `falcon180b-19816` around the lines where `buffer` is accessed.
why: If this race condition is not resolved, it could result in data corruption or unexpected behavior of the application, compromising the integrity of the encrypted data.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering multiple threads to execute the encryption process simultaneously, causing inconsistent data states within the `buffer` array.
code-sources: The source of user input is the file `input.txt` which is read character-by-character into the buffer in the `main` function.
code-sinks: The buffer is processed (encrypted) by the `encrypt_thread` function which acts upon the user input stored in `buffer`.

    pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, encrypt_thread, (void*)&start);
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
    pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
  }

  time_t end_time = time(NULL);
  double elapsed_time = difftime(end_time, start_time);

  fprintf(output_file, "Encryption completed in %.2f seconds\n", elapsed_time);

  fclose(input_file);
  fclose(output_file);

  return 0;
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t buffer_mutex`) to synchronize access to the `buffer` array, ensuring that only one thread can modify `buffer` at a time. This prevents concurrent access and potential data corruption arising from the race condition.
