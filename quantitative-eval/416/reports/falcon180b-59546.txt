    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-59546 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is caused by improper synchronization when handling the `clients` array and the `num_clients` variable. The `num_clients` and `clients` array are accessed and modified by multiple threads without proper locking, which can lead to race conditions and undefined behavior.
    where: 
    - Code that modifies the `num_clients` and `clients` array: 
      Lines in `main` function:
      ```c
      clients[num_clients] = client_socket;
      num_clients++;
      ```
      Lines in `handle_client` function where `clients` array is accessed:
      ```c
      for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) {
          if (clients[i] != client_socket) {
              send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
          }
      }
      ```
    why: If this weakness is not resolved, the server might crash, or clients might receive corrupted or unintended data. Additionally, a race condition here could be exploited to cause denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or data leaks.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending data simultaneously from multiple clients, causing a race condition that corrupts the server's `clients` array or `num_clients` variable.
    code-sources: 
    - User input enters through sockets in `handle_client` function with the `recv` call:
      ```c
      int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
      ```
    code-sinks: 
    - Actions performed using user input from sources include printing the data to console and sending to other clients:
      ```c
      printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
      send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
      ```

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves adding a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to synchronize access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. The mutex is locked before these shared resources are accessed or modified and unlocked after the operation completes. This ensures that these resources are accessed by one thread at a time, preventing race conditions.
