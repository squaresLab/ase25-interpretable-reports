vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-42320 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code is handling client connections using threads, where the same `client_socket` variable is passed to the thread. Due to the race condition, multiple threads may access and modify `client_socket` concurrently.
where: The vulnerability occurs in `main` function when `pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);` is called.
why: If not resolved, this race condition could lead to unexpected behavior such as data corruption, crashes, or security breaches due to threads working on unexpected socket values.
how: An attacker could exploit this by causing multiple client connections in quick succession, leading to a scenario where threads overwrite each other's `client_socket` value, causing erroneous reads or writes.
code-sources: Entry point for user input is in the `handle_client` function when `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` is called.
code-sinks: Action performed by the application using user input is in the `send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` function in both `handle_client` and `main`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix resolves the race condition by dynamically allocating memory for each `client_socket`. This ensures each thread works with a distinct `client_socket` value, avoiding race conditions.
