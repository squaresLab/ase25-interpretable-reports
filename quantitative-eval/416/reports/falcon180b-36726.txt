    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-36726 (severity: High)
    what: The code doesn't properly handle the case when more data is received than what the buffer `buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` can accommodate, which can cause a buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability is in the `handle_client` function of the falcon180b-36726 file.
    why: If a buffer overflow occurs, it could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the server or disrupt its normal operation.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending data that exceeds the size of the buffer, causing adjacent memory to be overwritten and potentially executing malicious code.
    code-sources: User input is received through the `recv` call in the `handle_client` function on the line `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`.
    code-sinks: The `buffer` is later used in a `printf` statement and sent to other clients using `send`, both of which rely on the integrity of the buffer to function correctly.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix reserves space for the null terminator by changing the `recv` call to receive one less than the buffer size (`BUFFER_SIZE - 1`). It also explicitly sets the last byte of the buffer to `\0` to ensure it is null-terminated, preventing buffer overflow and preserving string integrity.
