vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-9835 (severity: High)
what: The code fails to adequately prevent buffer overflows when receiving data from clients, leading to potential overwriting of memory and subsequent execution of arbitrary code.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function in the file falcon180b-9835. Specifically, at the lines where `recv` is being used without checking if the received data fits into the buffer.
why: An attacker could exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary code, crash the server, or corrupt memory, leading to potential denial of service or further attacks on the system.
how: An attacker would proceed by sending data exceeding the `BUFFER_SIZE` to the server, which would overflow the `buffer` in the `handle_client` function. This can overwrite adjacent memory or important control structures, leading to control over execution flow.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is at `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The critical action performed by the application is the `recv` function call that places data into the `buffer` without properly checking its size against `BUFFER_SIZE`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff increases the buffer size by one to accommodate the null terminator and adds a check to verify if the received data exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`. If the data exceeds the limit, the connection is terminated, preventing a buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
