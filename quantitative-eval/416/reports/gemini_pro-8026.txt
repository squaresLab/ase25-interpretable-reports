 
vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in gemini_pro-8026 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability exists in the handling of client connections where the same memory address (containing client_socket) is being passed to multiple threads without protection, potentially causing threads to operate on an invalid or incorrect socket descriptor.
where: Lines 62-67 in gemini_pro-8026
why: If not resolved, a race condition can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities where one client's data might be sent to another client.
how: An attacker could exploit this by flooding the server with multiple connections simultaneously, potentially leading to race conditions that cause security breaches, data corruption, or application crashes.
code-sources: `accept` function call in the main loop on line 60.
code-sinks: Use of `client_socket` in the `handle_client` function on line 33.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix dynamically allocates memory for each `client_socket` and passes a unique pointer to each thread. This prevents race conditions by ensuring that each thread operates on a different memory address, thus avoiding conflicts.
