vuln-fix: Missing Synchronization (CWE-662) in falcon180b-10080 lines 26-53 (severity: High)
what: The code does not correctly manage concurrent access to shared data (`client_sockets` and `num_clients`). This can result in race conditions and data corruption when multiple clients are connected to the server concurrently.
where: Lines 26-53 in falcon180b-10080
why: Failing to properly synchronize access to shared data could allow an attacker to cause undefined behavior, crashes, or incorrect program logic, leading to potential security vulnerabilities.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing the race condition to occur, resulting in denial of service or taking over client connections.
code-sources: User input enters the application through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The entries in the `client_sockets` array are used by the `send` function to communicate with clients.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix introduces a `pthread_mutex_t` named `client_lock` to manage concurrent access to the `client_sockets` array and the `num_clients` variable. The `pthread_mutex_lock(&client_lock)` and `pthread_mutex_unlock(&client_lock)` functions are used to ensure that these critical sections (modifications to shared variables and array) are accessed by only one thread at a time, thereby preventing race conditions.
