vuln-fix: CWE-134: Use of Externally-Controlled Format String in falcon180b-10629 at lines 15 and 18 (severity: High)
what: The code uses `printf` to output the client's message directly without sanitizing the input. This can lead to format string vulnerabilities if the user input contains format specifiers.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at these lines:
```c
printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
```
why: Not resolving this vulnerability can allow an attacker to manipulate the format string, leading to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or information leaks.
how: An attacker could send a message containing format specifiers like `%x`, `%s`, etc., which would then be interpreted by `printf`. Depending on the specifiers used, this could leak memory contents or crash the server.
code-sources: The source of user input is in the `recv` function call at line 13:
```c
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
```
code-sinks: The sink where user input is used unsafely is in the `printf` function call at line 15:
```c
printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
```

     }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The vulnerability is resolved by using the `snprintf` function instead of `printf`. `snprintf` allows for the safe formatting of strings by limiting the amount of data written and avoiding direct interpretation of user input for formatting. Using `fputs` to print the output further prevents potential issues with format strings.
