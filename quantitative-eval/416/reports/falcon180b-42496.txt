    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-42496, handle_client function (lines 15-28) (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly validate user input size before copying it into a buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the function `handle_client` at lines 15-28 in the file falcon180b-42496.
    why: A buffer overflow could lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the server or crash it.
    how: An attacker could send a large amount of data to overflow the buffer `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];`, which might overwrite adjacent memory, containing pointers, control data, or other variables leading to arbitrary code execution.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function:  `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`.
    code-sinks: The buffer `buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` that holds data received from the client in the `handle_client` function, and the `send` function that sends this data to other clients.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that `recv` receives a maximum of `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes to leave space for a null-terminator. Furthermore, by explicitly setting `buffer[bytes_received]` to `'\0'`, we ensure the buffer is always null-terminated, which helps prevent buffer overflow and possible string-related vulnerabilities.
