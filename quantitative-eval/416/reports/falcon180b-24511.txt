vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-121) in falcon180b-24511 at lines 15-17 (severity: High)
what: The code reads data from a socket into a fixed-size buffer `request` of 1024 bytes without checking if the received data exceeds the buffer size, leading to a potential buffer overflow vulnerability.
where: The vulnerability is located at lines 15-17 in the file falcon180b-24511:
```c
recv(client_socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0);
```
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could overflow the buffer with more data than it can hold, leading to memory corruption. This could result in a crash, arbitrary code execution, or even a complete system compromise.
how: An attacker would proceed to exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted payload to the target server that exceeds the buffer size of 1024 bytes, causing the buffer overflow:
```python
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('target_ip', 8080))
payload = b'A' * 2048  # Exceeding the buffer size
s.send(payload)
s.close()
```
code-sources: The entry point where user input enters the application is the `recv` function called within `handle_client` function (line 15):
```c
recv(client_socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0);
```
code-sinks: The action performed by the application using this user input is the `printf` function where it outputs the received request (line 16):
```c
printf("Received request from client %d: %s\n", client_socket, request);
```

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer `request` will not overflow by limiting the `recv` call to `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE - 1` bytes and properly null-terminating the string. It also handles the case where `recv` returns an error.
