    vuln-fix: Uninitialized Variable (CWE-457) in falcon180b-64660 at line 56 (severity: High)
    what: The 'num_fibonacci' variable is used without being initialized in the main function. This usage can lead to undefined behavior when the Fibonacci sequence is printed.
    where: Line 56 of falcon180b-64660
    why: If 'num_fibonacci' is not initialized, it could contain any arbitrary value. This means the loop that prints the Fibonacci sequence could access elements outside the bounds of the array, leading to potential crashes, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.
    how: An attacker could provide crafted input or influence the program state through external means to control uninitialized variables, potentially causing the program to crash or behave unpredictably, facilitating further exploitation.
    code-sources: No explicit user input in the provided code fragment; the vulnerability is due to internal mismanagement of variables.
    code-sinks: The loop at line 56 in the main function where 'num_fibonacci' is used without initialization.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The code change initializes 'num_fibonacci' to 'NUM_FIBONACCI' right after the semaphore initialization. This ensures that 'num_fibonacci' has a valid value before being used in the loop that prints the Fibonacci sequence, thus preventing out-of-bounds access.
    method: UNKNOWN
