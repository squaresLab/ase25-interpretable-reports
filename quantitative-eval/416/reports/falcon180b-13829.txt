vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120/787/805) in falcon180b-13829 (severity: High)
what: Buffer write operations that do not control the length of data written may overflow.
where: The buffer overflow vulnerability is located in falcon180b-13829 at line 49.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, leading to a full compromise of the system.
how: An attacker would send a specially crafted request to the server that exceeds the buffer size, causing the application to write beyond the buffer boundaries, potentially overwriting critical memory and allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
code-sources: 
  - The user input enters the application via the `recv` function on line 32.
code-sinks: 
  - The user input is subsequently used in an unsafe `strcat` function on line 49, which is the point of the buffer overflow.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff replaces the unsafe `strcat` with `strncat`, ensuring that the concatenation operation does not exceed the buffer's size. This prevents buffer overflow by controlling the length of the data written to the buffer.
