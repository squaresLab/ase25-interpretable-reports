vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in gemini_pro-1448 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a race condition due to the shared memory (`shared_mem`) being accessed and modified by multiple threads without proper synchronization of the variable `i` used as the thread argument.
where: The vulnerability is located in `gemini_pro-1448` at lines where threads are created and joined: lines 25-35 and in the thread function at lines 14-20.
why: If not resolved, this weakness can cause unpredictable behavior, data corruption, and application crashes due to concurrent modification of shared resources. 
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating and manipulating thread execution to access and potentially alter shared memory in a way that disrupts expected behavior, leading to application failures or data leaks.
code-sources: The thread function `thread_function` is where the shared memory is accessed and modified, using the thread ID passed to it from the `main` function.
code-sinks: The actions performed by the application include writing to the shared memory in the `thread_function` after locking the mutex.
suggested-fix:
```diff
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the number of threads
#define NUM_THREADS 4

// Define the size of the shared memory block
#define SHARED_MEM_SIZE 1024

// Define the mutex
pthread_mutex_t mutex;

// Define the shared memory block
char shared_mem[SHARED_MEM_SIZE];

// Define the thread function
void *thread_function(void *arg) {
    // Get the thread ID
    int thread_id = *((int *) arg);

    // Lock the mutex
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

    // Write to the shared memory block
    sprintf(shared_mem, "Thread %d: %s", thread_id, "Hello, world!");

    // Unlock the mutex
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    // Create the threads
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
+   int thread_ids[NUM_THREADS];
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
+       thread_ids[i] = i;
+       pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_function, (void *) &thread_ids[i]);
    }

    // Join the threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    // Print the shared memory block
    printf("%s\n", shared_mem);

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix resolves the race condition by ensuring that each thread receives a unique and immutable thread ID for its execution. This is achieved by storing the thread IDs in a dedicated array (`thread_ids[NUM_THREADS]`) and passing the address of each respective element to the thread creation function (`pthread_create`). This eliminates the race condition on the `i` variable.
