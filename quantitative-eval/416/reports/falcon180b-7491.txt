vuln-fix: CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write in falcon180b-7491 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code fails to check the return value of the `recv` function, leading to a potential out-of-bounds write in the `buffer`.
where: Lines involving `recv` in `handle_client` function, specifically in falcon180b-7491.
why: If the vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could send a specifically crafted payload that causes a buffer overflow, potentially leading to remote code execution or crashing the server.
how: An attacker could send a message larger than the `BUFFER_SIZE` or malformed data to exploit the vulnerability, causing a buffer overflow and manipulate the program's memory.
code-sources: The `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function is the entry point where user input enters the application.
code-sinks: The `buffer` array in the `handle_client` function where `recv` stores the user input.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change adds proper error handling for the `recv` function call, ensuring that if a negative value is returned, the server properly handles the error and closes the client connection. Additionally, it checks if `bytes_received` exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE` to prevent potential buffer overflow.
