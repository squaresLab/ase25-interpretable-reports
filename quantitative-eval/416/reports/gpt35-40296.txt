vuln-fix: CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in gpt35-40296 (severity: High)
what: The server code is susceptible to a TOCTOU race condition because the `client_sock` variable is passed by reference to the `handle_connection` function when creating a new thread.
where: In the `main()` function, the line `pthread_create(&tid, NULL, handle_connection, &client_sock)` around line 44.
why: A potential consequence of this vulnerability is that an attacker could influence which client socket is used by the thread before the thread reads the socket data, potentially causing misdirection of the client responses.
how: An attacker could create multiple, near-simultaneous connections to the server, potentially occupying the `client_sock` variable after the parent thread reads the client data but before it is passed to the `handle_connection` thread. This could lead to incorrect client being serviced by the thread.
code-sources: User input is received in the function `handle_connection` from the socket read operation `read(client_sock, buffer, 1024);`.
code-sinks: The application performs various actions like sending HTTP response data back to the client socket via `write(client_sock, RESPONSE, strlen(RESPONSE));`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by dynamically allocating memory for each client socket file descriptor and passing the pointer to the newly allocated memory to the thread. This prevents the race condition on the `client_sock` variable by ensuring that each thread gets its own distinct client socket value.
method: UNKNOWN
