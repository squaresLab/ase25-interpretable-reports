vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-32167 (severity: High)
what: The code is vulnerable to a race condition. The global variable `num_clients` is modified without proper synchronization. Multiple threads can concurrently access this variable, leading to undefined behavior or corruption.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function:
- Line 13: `num_clients--` (decrement without synchronization)
- Line 54: `num_clients++` (increment without synchronization)
why: If the race condition is not resolved, it can lead to inconsistent state of the `num_clients` variable, resulting in possible crashes, data corruption, and potentially allowing more clients than the limit to connect or denying connections when space is available.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting multiple clients, potentially causing the server to mismanage the `num_clients` count, leading to service disruptions or crashes.
code-sources: User input enters the application at:
- Line 41: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` (receiving data from the client)
code-sinks: Actions performed by the application using user input:
- Line 46: `send(clients[i], buffer, bytes_received, 0);` (sending data to other clients)

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff uses a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t clients_mutex`) to synchronize access to the shared resource `num_clients` and the `clients` array. This prevents race conditions by ensuring that only one thread can modify these shared resources at a time, thereby maintaining data consistency.
