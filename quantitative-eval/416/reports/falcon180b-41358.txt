vuln-fix: CWE-825: Return of stack variable address in falcon180b-41358 line 34 (severity: high)
what: A function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory. This memory is deallocated at the end of the function, which may lead the caller to dereference a dangling pointer.
where: Line 34 in the file falcon180b-41358
why: Calling code will dereference a memory location that is no longer valid, leading to undefined behavior, including crashes and potential security vulnerabilities.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the program flow to dereference a dangling pointer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or program crashes.
code-sources: `name`, `address`, and `phone_number` entries in the main function.
code-sinks: `get_input` function returning a pointer to a stack-allocated `input` array.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff changes the `get_input` function so that it does not return a pointer to a stack-allocated array. Instead, it directly populates the provided buffer, eliminating the risk of returning a dangling pointer.

vuln-fix: CWE-120, CWE-787, and CWE-805: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-41358 line 44 (severity: critical)
what: Buffer write operations that do not control the length of data written may overflow.
where: Line 44 in the file falcon180b-41358
why: Buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or crashes, posing both a security and stability risk.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing input that exceeds the allocated buffer size, causing an overflow and potentially overwriting critical data on the stack.
code-sources: `name` entry from user input in the main function.
code-sinks: `get_input` function potentially causing buffer overflow when copying the return value into the `name` array.

explanation-suggested-fix: By directly using `get_input` to populate the `name` buffer, we ensure that the buffer handling is consistent and that any overflow will be avoided by the sanitizing and limiting logic within `get_input`.
