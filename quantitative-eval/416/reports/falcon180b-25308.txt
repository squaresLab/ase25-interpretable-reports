vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-25308 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly check the size of data received from clients before copying it to a fixed-size buffer, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.
where: Vulnerability is primarily in the `handle_client` function, specifically lines where `recv` populates the `buffer` without size checks.
why: If not resolved, an attacker can exploit this to cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the server or potentially execute arbitrary code by overwriting memory.
how: An attacker can send data larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` (1024 bytes) to the server, causing an overflow in the buffer and potentially controlling the application's behavior or leading to a crash.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: The vulnerable code sinks are the `recv` function in `handle_client` and the subsequent operations on the `buffer`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the buffer is null-terminated, preventing a potential overflow when `recv` receives more data than the buffer can safely hold. Additionally, it ensures that the remaining buffer space is managed correctly to avoid overwriting memory.
