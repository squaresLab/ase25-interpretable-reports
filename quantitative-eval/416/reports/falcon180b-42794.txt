vuln-fix: CWE-676 (Use of Potentially Dangerous Function) and CWE-362 (Race Condition) in falcon180b-42794 line 17 and 44 (severity: High)
what: The code contains improper synchronization leading to a race condition, and it uses the `strlen` function on potentially non-null-terminated buffers.
where: 
- Race condition in line 44: `pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);`
- Improper use of `strlen` in line 17: `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`
why: Failure to address the race condition could allow attackers to interfere with the server's operations, potentially causing data corruption or denial of service. The use of `strlen` on a non-null-terminated buffer could lead to information leakage or buffer overflows.
how: An attacker can exploit the race condition by quickly sending multiple connection requests to the server, potentially causing the server to overwrite client_socket values, disrupting client communication. They can also send crafted input to cause the `buffer` to be improperly processed by `strlen`, leading to information leakage or execution of unintended commands.
code-sources: 
- User input from network connections at line 31: `int client_socket = accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &addr_size);`
- Received data processing at line 17: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
code-sinks: 
- Logging user input at line 23: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);`
- Broadcasting user input to other clients at line 26.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix resolves the vulnerabilities by ensuring proper synchronization with a mutex (pthread_mutex_t) around the critical sections of code that modify shared resources, preventing race conditions, and by ensuring the received data is null-terminated, mitigating buffer overflow and information leakage risks.
