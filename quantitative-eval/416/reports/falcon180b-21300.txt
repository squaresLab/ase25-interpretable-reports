vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-21300 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition in the handling of the `clients` array because the `num_clients` variable and array updates are not protected by any synchronization mechanism.
where: Lines 11, 18-19, 34-35, 41-45 in the file falcon180b-21300.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, it could lead to undefined behavior, such as crashed client handling threads, corrupted memory, or even security vulnerabilities like unauthorized code execution.
how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by making concurrent connections and disconnections from multiple clients, potentially causing the array to be accessed and modified unsafely across different threads.
code-sources: 
- User input can be received from the network via the `recv` function within the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: 
- Processing and sending the received data back to the client using `printf` and `send` functions within the `handle_client` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix adds a `pthread_mutex_t` to ensure synchronization when accessing and modifying the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. Each modification to the shared resources is enclosed within `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` calls, ensuring that only one thread can access these critical sections at a time.
