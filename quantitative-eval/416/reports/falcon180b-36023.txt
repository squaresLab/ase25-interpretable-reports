vuln-fix: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') (CWE-22) and Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-36023 (severity: High)
what: The application does not properly handle buffer sizes in recv and uses user-controlled input in printf without sanitization. This allows an attacker to cause a buffer overflow and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server, as well as perform Format String vulnerabilities.
where: 
1. recv(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0); in thread_client function.
2. printf("Client %d: %s\n", sock, buffer); in thread_client function.
why: 
1. Buffer Overflows can lead to arbitrary code execution and compromise the system hosting the code.
2. Improper handling of format strings can result in leaking sensitive information or executing arbitrary code.
how: An attacker can craft a payload that exceeds the BUFFER_SIZE or includes malicious format specifiers that leverage the lack of sanitization on the buffer which could execute arbitrary code or leak memory content.
code-sources: recv(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
code-sinks: printf("Client %d: %s\n", sock, buffer);

explanation-suggested-fix: Ensuring that the buffer is properly null-terminated prevents potential buffer overflows. Using formatted string specifiers with a length specifier limits the risk of format string vulnerabilities. The change to `recv` ensures that no more than `BUFFER_SIZE-1` characters are read, leaving space for the null terminator.
