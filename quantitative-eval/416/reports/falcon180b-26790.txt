vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-26790 (severity: High)
what: This code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability. Specifically, there is a possibility that user input read from the `recv` function into the fixed-size buffer `buffer` can exceed its allocated size of BUFFER_SIZE (1000 bytes).
where: The vulnerable code is located in the `handle_client` function, where `recv` is called, starting from line 17 and continues throughout the function handling the received data.
why: If this buffer overflow is exploited, it can lead to memory corruption, which can cause the application to crash, or even allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the affected process.
how: An attacker can send a crafted message that exceeds the BUFFER_SIZE to the server. Since the `recv` function does not perform bounds checking on the length of buffer it writes to, this overflow can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially causing arbitrary code execution.
code-sources: 
- User input is read through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: 
- The potentially overflowing user input is stored in the `buffer` array and used in the `send` function in the same `handle_client` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures buffer size is never exceeded by setting the maximum length to be read by the `recv` function to BUFFER_SIZE - 1. This retains space for a null terminator, thus preventing buffer overflow.
