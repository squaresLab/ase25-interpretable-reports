vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-67728 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code lacks proper synchronization when handling the `clients` array and the `num_clients` variable. Multiple threads access and modify these shared resources without using mutex locks or other synchronization mechanisms.
where: 
- File: falcon180b-67728
- Lines: Multiple instances across the file, particularly within the `main` method and the `handle_client` function.
why: Failure to resolve this weakness can lead to race conditions, resulting in corrupted data, crashes, and unpredictable behavior of the server. It could allow an attacker to exploit these conditions to disrupt the server's operations or execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker could induce race conditions by flooding the server with multiple connection requests simultaneously, causing threads to access and modify shared variables concurrently without proper synchronization.
code-sources: 
- Entry point: `accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &client_size)` in the `main` function
code-sinks: 
- Actions: `clients[num_clients] = client_socket` and `num_clients++` in the `main` function
- Sending data: `send(clients[i], buffer, bytes_received, 0)` in the `handle_client` function
suggested-fix: 
```diff
#include <pthread.h>

pthread_mutex_t clients_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void *handle_client(void *arg) {
    int client_socket = *(int *) arg;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    while (1) {
        memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);

        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            close(client_socket);
            pthread_exit(NULL);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) {
            if (clients[i] != client_socket) {
                send(clients[i], buffer, bytes_received, 0);
            }
        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&clients_mutex);
    }

    // existing code

        // existing code

        if (client_socket == -1) {
            printf("Error accepting connection\n");
            continue;
        }

        if (num_clients >= MAX_CLIENTS) {
            close(client_socket);
            continue;
        }

        pthread_mutex_lock(&clients_mutex);
        clients[num_clients] = client_socket;
        num_clients++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&clients_mutex);

        pthread_t thread_id;
        pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix uses a `pthread_mutex_t` named `clients_mutex` to protect access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By locking the mutex before modifying shared resources and unlocking it afterward, the code ensures that only one thread can access these resources at a time, preventing race conditions and data corruption.
