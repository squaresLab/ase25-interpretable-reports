vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in gpt35-76373 between lines 14-80 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability arises due to improper synchronization when accessing the `clientCount` variable and `clientSockets` array. Specifically, there is a potential race condition because the `clientHandler` thread concurrently modifies `clientCount` without adequate locking, risking inconsistent state.
where: The vulnerability is present in the `clientHandler` function within the gpt35-76373 file, lines 29-64.
why: If left unresolved, this vulnerability could lead to incorrect management of client connections, leading to possible application crashes, resource leaks, or other unpredictable behaviors.
how: An attacker might exploit this vulnerability by deliberately timing requests to create race conditions, causing incorrect updates to the `clientCount` and `clientSockets` variables and triggering logic errors in the server's client management mechanisms.
code-sources: The `recv` function on line 35, which receives input from the client.
code-sinks: The `printf` and `send` functions on lines 43 and 53, respectively, which output received data.

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed changes ensure that the critical section where `clientCount` and `clientSockets` are updated is properly enclosed within the mutex lock. This prevents race conditions by ensuring that any changes to these shared resources are synchronized across multiple threads.
