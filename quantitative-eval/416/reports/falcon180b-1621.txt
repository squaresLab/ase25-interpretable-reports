vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-1621 (severity: High)
what: The code contains improper synchronization when accessing the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable in a multi-threaded environment. This can lead to race conditions, where multiple threads access or modify shared data concurrently, causing unpredictable behavior and potential security vulnerabilities.
where: The vulnerability is found in falcon180b-1621, specifically in the `main` function and `handle_client` function where the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed and modified without proper synchronization.
why: If not resolved, this weakness can lead to data corruption, crashes, or unauthorized access due to inconsistent state. In a worst-case scenario, it can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, leading to a severe security breach.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by overwhelming the server with multiple client connections at once, causing race conditions that corrupt the `client_sockets` array or `num_clients` variable. This can disrupt the server's operation, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS) conditions or allowing one client to interfere with another's communication.
code-sources: 
- User input enters the application via the `accept` function call that accepts client connections.
code-sinks:
- The application uses user input in the `recv` function to read messages and in the `send` function to broadcast messages to other clients.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by adding a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to synchronize access to the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable. This ensures that only one thread can modify these shared resources at a time, preventing race conditions. Additionally, the fix includes a clean-up procedure for removing a disconnected client's socket from the `client_sockets` array within the protected critical section. Also, `pthread_detach()` is used to ensure that thread resources are automatically released upon termination, avoiding memory leaks.
