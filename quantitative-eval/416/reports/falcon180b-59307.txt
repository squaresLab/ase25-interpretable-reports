    vuln-fix: CWE-134: Uncontrolled Format String in falcon180b-59307.c:19 (severity: High)
    what: The code uses `printf` with a variable `buffer` directly derived from user input. This can lead to a format string vulnerability.
    where: 
    ```
    falcon180b-59307.c:19
        printf("Thread %d received message: %s\n", sock, buffer);
    ```
    why: An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, cause a crash, or read unintended memory locations.
    how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message containing format specifiers like `%x` or `%n` to manipulate the program's execution.
    code-sources: 
    ```
    falcon180b-59307.c:13
        int bytes_recv = recv(sock, buffer, MAX, 0);
    ```
    code-sinks: 
    ```
    falcon180b-59307.c:19
        printf("Thread %d received message: %s\n", sock, buffer);
    ```
    suggested-fix: 
    ```diff
    19c19
    <        printf("Thread %d received message: %s\n", sock, buffer);
    ---
    >        printf("Thread %d received message: %.99s\n", sock, buffer);
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change ensures that the user-controlled input `buffer` is safely printed with a specified maximum length to prevent format string vulnerabilities.
    method: UNKNOWN
