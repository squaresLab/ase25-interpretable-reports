vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-5414 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function when receiving data from a client.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in the lines involving `recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);` and subsequent use of `buffer` in falcon180b-5414.
why: An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code or cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS).
how: An attacker would send data exceeding the buffer size (`1024` bytes) to overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions, leading to code execution or program crash.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The application then proceeds to print the buffer content with `printf`, and handle the next client requests.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds a step to ensure the received data is within bounds by limiting the `recv` call to `sizeof(buffer) - 1`, leaving space for a null-terminator. This prevents buffer overflow. Furthermore, the received data is explicitly null-terminated to avoid printing or processing memory content beyond the intended buffer size.
