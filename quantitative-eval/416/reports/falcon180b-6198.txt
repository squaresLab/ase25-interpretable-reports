vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-6198 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability where user input is read into a fixed-size buffer (`char buffer[1024]`) without proper bounds checking.
where: Lines 20-22 in the `handle_client` function within falcon180b-6198
why: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to overwrite adjacent memory spaces, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption.
how: An attacker could send a payload larger than 1024 bytes to the server. Since the code does not check the size of the incoming data, the payload would overflow the buffer and could overwrite the return address or other critical data on the stack.
code-sources: Entry points are in the main function where the server sets up the socket and accepts connections.
code-sinks: The sink is in the `handle_client` function where the `recv` function receives data into the `buffer` and the `send` function sends data to other clients.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves two main changes. First, `recv` is called with `sizeof(buffer) - 1` to leave room for a null terminator. Second, the code ensures null-termination of the buffer by writing `\0` to the position immediately after the bytes received (i.e., `buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';`). This prevents buffer overflow and ensures the string is properly terminated.
