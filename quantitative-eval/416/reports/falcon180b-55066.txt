    vuln-fix: Unbounded Memory Allocation (CWE-789) in falcon180b-55066, lines 13-19 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is due to the handling of a large amount of data without proper checks, leading to unbounded memory allocation and potential buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in the lines where user input is received using `recv` and written to the `buffer` on lines 13-19.
    why: If the weakness is not resolved, an attacker can exploit this to crash the server or execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service or potential takeover of the server.
    how: An attacker would send a maliciously crafted message exceeding the `BUFFER_SIZE` of 1024 bytes, causing the `buffer` to overflow and possibly overwriting adjacent memory, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    code-sources: The entry point where user input enters the application is the `recv` call on line 16 in the `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: The action performed by the application using user input is the `printf` call on line 18 and the `send` call on line 20 in the `handle_client` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change introduces checks to ensure that too large messages are identified and not processed further. It ensures the buffer is not overflowed by handling messages that are exactly or larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`. This mitigates the risk of a buffer overflow attack.
