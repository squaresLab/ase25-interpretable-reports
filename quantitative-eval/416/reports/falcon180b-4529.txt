    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-4529 (severity: High)
    what: A race condition vulnerability exists due to improper handling of client socket assignments in a multi-threaded environment.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the main function around line 59-75 and in the handle_client function around line 19-41.
    why: If this race condition is exploited, an attacker could potentially cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by flooding the server with rapid connections, causing erroneous client socket indexing and unexpected behavior in client communication.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting clients. This can lead to incorrect client handling or overwriting of the client_sockets array due to multiple threads accessing and modifying the array concurrently without synchronization.
    code-sources: The user input enters at the accept function call in the main function (around line 65).
    code-sinks: The user input from the client is used in the recv function in the handle_client function (around line 26).

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by adding a mutex lock around the critical section where the client_sockets array and num_clients variable are accessed and modified. This ensures that only one thread can make changes to these variables at a time, preventing race conditions.
    method: UNKNOWN
