vuln-fix: CWE-362 Concurrency Issues in falcon180b-20787 (severity: High)
what: The code has a concurrency issue where multiple threads access and modify shared variables without proper synchronization.
where: In the file falcon180b-20787, particularly in the accept_connections() and handle_client() functions.
why: If the shared variables are not properly synchronized, this could cause race conditions, leading to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential security vulnerabilities.
how: An attacker could trigger a race condition by connecting multiple clients simultaneously, causing unpredictable behavior in the server and potentially leading to a denial-of-service or other unintended consequences.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the client connections accepted by the `accept_connections()` function.
code-sinks: The handling of user messages in the `handle_client()` function and the increment of `num_clients` in `accept_connections()` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff modifies the `accept_connections` function to incorporate a mutex, `client_mutex`, to protect access to the shared variable `num_clients`. This ensures that incrementing `num_clients` is done atomically, preventing race conditions.
