    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-11159 (severity: High)
    what: The given code spawns a new thread for each client connection without proper synchronization mechanisms. This can lead to race conditions with shared variables like `num_clients` and `client_sockets`.
    where: 
       - In the `handle_client` function and the main loop around the `pthread_create` call, lines managing `num_clients` and `client_sockets` in falcon180b-11159. 
       - Specifically in the increment of `num_clients` and assignment to `client_sockets`.
    why: Without proper synchronization, race conditions may occur, leading to corrupted data, crashes, or undefined behavior. An attacker can exploit these race conditions to disrupt the server or execute arbitrary code.
    how: An attacker could repeatedly connect and disconnect from the server, causing the race condition to manifest, potentially leading to server instability or crashes.
    code-sources: The entry point is the `accept()` function call which establishes a new client connection and the `recv()` function call which receives data from the client.
    code-sinks: The variables `client_sockets` and `num_clients` are modified based on user input, received via the `accept()` and `recv()` system calls.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix uses a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to ensure that operations modifying shared variables `num_clients` and `client_sockets` are performed atomically. This prevents race conditions by ensuring that only one thread at a time can modify these variables.
