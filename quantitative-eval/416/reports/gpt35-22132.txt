vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in gpt35-22132 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write due to a lack of bounds checking on the `buffer` in the `connection_handler` function. When receiving data with the `read` function, there's no check to verify that the data being read will fit within the allocated size of `buffer`.
where: Lines 62-71 in the file gpt35-22132.
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, leading to a potential full system compromise.
how: An attacker would connect to the server and send a payload larger than 1024 bytes, resulting in the overflow of the `buffer` and potentially overwriting adjacent memory. This can allow the attacker to inject and execute malicious code.
code-sources: The `read` function on line 62 where user input is received.
code-sinks: The `send` function on line 70 which sends the potentially corrupted buffer back to the client.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds a check to ensure that if the number of bytes read is greater than or equal to the size of the `buffer`, an error is flagged and the connection is closed. This prevents out-of-bounds writes and potential buffer overflow exploits, mitigating the vulnerability.
method: UNKNOWN
