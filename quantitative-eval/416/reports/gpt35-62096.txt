vuln-fix: Buffer Write Operations Without Length Control (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gpt35-62096 (severity: High)
what: Buffer write operations that do not control the length of data written may overflow, leading to potential buffer overflows and memory corruption.
where: 
  - Line 75: `recv(socket_fd, username, 32, 0);`
  - Line 117: `sprintf(message, "%s: %s", username, buffer);`
why: Not resolving this weakness can result in buffer overflow vulnerabilities, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or application crashes.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted payloads that exceed the buffer size limits, thus causing memory corruption or execution of malicious code.
code-sources: Any input from the client that is received by the server socket, especially functions like `recv()`.
code-sinks: Operations that write received data to a buffer without appropriate length checks, such as `recv()` and `sprintf()`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix replaces `recv` and `sprintf` with safer alternatives to prevent buffer overflows. It adds length checks that ensure received data is adequately bounded and properly terminated with a null character. `recv` now only copies `31` bytes and null-terminates the `username` buffer to prevent overflow. Similarly, `snprintf` is used instead of `sprintf` to avoid writing past the bounds of the buffer `message`.
