vuln-fix: CWE-119: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-64145 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability originates from the buffer used in the `handle_client` function, which reads data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.
where: Lines 13-35 in the file falcon180b-64145
why: By not handling buffer overflows correctly, an attacker could send a message that exceeds `BUF_SIZE` (1024 bytes), causing a buffer overflow, which could lead to arbitrary code execution, application crashes, or data corruption.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message that exceeds 1024 bytes to the server. The overflowed buffer could overwrite adjacent memory, potentially modifying program behavior or control flow.
code-sources: `read(client_socket, buffer, BUF_SIZE)` in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: `write(clients[i], buffer, bytes_read)` in the `handle_client` function and `write(clients[i], message, strlen(message))` in the `broadcast_message` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes address the buffer overflow vulnerability by performing bounds checking on the buffer. Specifically, the `read` function now reads up to `BUF_SIZE - 1` bytes instead of `BUF_SIZE` bytes, and the buffer is explicitly null-terminated by setting `buffer[bytes_read]` to `'\0'`. This prevents an overflow by ensuring that the buffer does not exceed its allocated size and is safely null-terminated.
