    vuln-fix: Missing Check for Return Value of `accept()` (CWE-252) in falcon180b-46303 (severity: High)
    what: The code lacks a check for the return value of the `accept()` function. If `accept()` fails, it could return `-1`, leading to undefined behavior when the `client_socket` variable is used.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function where the `accept()` function call returns the `client_socket` (around line 41) and in the `handle_client` function where `recv()` function call processes the `client_socket` (around line 17).
    why: Failure to properly handle the return value of `accept()` can lead to undefined behavior such as attempting to read or write from an invalid socket descriptor, potentially leading to crashes or exploitation by attackers to perform denial of service attacks.
    how: An attacker can repeatedly cause the server to try to accept connections, leading to a condition where the `accept()` function fails and returns `-1`. This could cause the server to behave unpredictably, potentially resulting in a denial of service as the server may crash or become unresponsive.
    code-sources: The `accept()` function call in the main loop around line 41.
    code-sinks: The `recv()` function call within `handle_client` function at line 17 and subsequent usage of `client_socket` without validation.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff adds a check to ensure `client_socket` is not negative after calling `accept()` and that it is within the range of valid file descriptors. By doing this, it avoids using an invalid `client_socket` that can lead to undefined behavior.
