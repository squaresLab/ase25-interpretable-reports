vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-1604.c (severity: High)
what: The application does not ensure that the data received from a client will fit within the buffer used to store it. Specifically, the call to `recv` in the `handle_client` function may cause the buffer to overflow if `bytes_received` exceeds `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, starting at line 20 in the file falcon180b-1604.c.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could cause a buffer overflow, which may result in arbitrary code execution, application crashes, or corruption of data.
how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request larger than `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE` bytes to the server. This would overflow the buffer and potentially allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or disrupt the service.
code-sources: The `recv` function on line 22, which receives data from the connected client.
code-sinks: The `send` function on line 32, which sends back the received data to the client.

explanation-suggested-fix: By increasing the buffer size by 1 and ensuring the buffer is null-terminated after data is received, the fix prevents buffer overflow and ensures safe handling of received data. This measures against potential misuse of the buffer overflowing its allocated space.
