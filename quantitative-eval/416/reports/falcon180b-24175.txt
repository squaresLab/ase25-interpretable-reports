vuln-fix: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-24175 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability here is a Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121) at the line where `recv()` is used to receive data from the client. The buffer `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]` may become overflown if the received bytes exceed `BUFFER_SIZE`.
where: Lines 12-35 in the file falcon180b-24175, specifically the call to `recv` within the `handle_client` function.
why: If this buffer overflow is not resolved, an attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server, which might lead to complete system compromise.
how: An attacker can send a payload larger than 1024 bytes to the server. Since the buffer `buffer` is only 1024 bytes in size, the excess data will overflow the buffer and can overwrite other parts of memory, possibly leading to code execution or application crash.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The buffer `buffer` in the `handle_client` function is where the user input is stored.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes reduce the possibility of a stack-based buffer overflow by ensuring that data written to `buffer` is always null-terminated and does not write more than `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes. This effectively prevents the buffer overflow.
