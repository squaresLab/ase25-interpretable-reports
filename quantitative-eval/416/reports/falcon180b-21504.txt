    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow CWE-120 in falcon180b-21504 (severity: High)
    what: The code allows for potential buffer overflow when handling client requests without proper bounds checking. Specifically, the `recv` function reads data into the `request` buffer of size `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE` without ensuring that the length of data received does not exceed `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`.
    where: In the `handle_client` function, particularly at the line `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0);`.
    why: If an attacker sends more data than can be held in the `request` buffer, it can result in a buffer overflow, which may corrupt adjacent memory and lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or even execution of malicious code.
    how: An attacker could continuously send oversized payloads in an attempt to overflow the buffer and overwrite adjacent memory, potentially injecting and executing malicious code or causing a denial of service.
    code-sources: The source for user input is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function where data is received from the client socket.
    code-sinks: The `request` buffer in `handle_client` where the received data is stored.

```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff limits the number of bytes received to `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE - 1`, leaving room for a null terminator which is added right after receiving the data. This ensures that the buffer `request` is null-terminated and prevents buffer overflow.
