vuln-fix: CWE-839: Numeric Range Comparison Without Minimum Check in falcon180b-66643 (severity: Medium)
what: The vulnerable code fails to properly validate that the number of clients metric (`num_clients`) remains within the bounds of predefined limits.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function, specifically in the following piece of the code:
   ```
   if(num_clients >= MAX_CLIENTS) {
       close(client_socket);
       printf("Maximum number of clients reached\n");
       continue;
   }
   ...
   clients[num_clients] = client_socket;
   num_clients++;
   ```
why: If this weakness is not resolved, it may lead to an array index out-of-bounds vulnerability, which can potentially cause the program to crash or lead to undefined behavior.
how: An attacker could artificially inflate the value of `num_clients` and cause the server to attempt writing outside the bounds of the `clients` array, potentially leading to a denial of service attack or other unpredictable behavior.
code-sources: The code entry point is the `accept` function when a new client connects.
code-sinks: The code sink is when `client_socket` is assigned to `clients[num_clients]` without adequate validation.
suggested-fix:

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff includes an additional check to ensure that `num_clients` cannot be artificially inflated. If `num_clients` is found to be less than 0, it is reset to 0. This guards against out-of-bounds array access and ensures array access remains valid.
