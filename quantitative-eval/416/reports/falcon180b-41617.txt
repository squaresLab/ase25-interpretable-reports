vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-41617 (severity: High)
what: The code has a potential buffer overflow vulnerability in the `buffer` array used within the `handle_client` function. Specifically, if a client sends data close to the `BUF_SIZE` limit, the `strlen` function in conjunction with the `send` function might exceed `buffer` capacity without proper bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.
where: In the `handle_client` function in falcon180b-41617 at lines 21-32.
why: Failure to resolve this buffer overflow could result in arbitrary code execution, crashing the server, or leaking sensitive information, leading to severe security breaches.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a carefully crafted payload that exceeds the size of the `buffer`, causing the application to overwrite memory. This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code or disrupt service.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUF_SIZE, 0);` at line 23.
code-sinks: `printf("Client %d says: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` at line 26 and `send(client_sock[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` at line 28.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves adding a check to ensure that the buffer is null-terminated within bounds. This prevents any buffer overflow by ensuring the buffer does not exceed its allocated size.
