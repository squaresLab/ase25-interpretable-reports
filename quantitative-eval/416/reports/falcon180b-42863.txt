vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-42863 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function. Specifically, if the data received from a client does not have a null-terminator within the first 1024 bytes, subsequent operations that assume null-terminated strings (like `strlen` and `printf`) can lead to out-of-bounds reads, causing undefined behavior.
where: Lines involving buffer manipulations inside `handle_client` function in falcon180b-42863:
```
23: int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
26: printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
29: send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
```
why: Not resolving this weakness can lead to buffer overflow, which can cause the server to crash, allow execution of arbitrary code, or leak sensitive information.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a packet of exactly 1024 bytes that does not include a null-terminator, causing subsequent operations like `printf` and `strlen` to read beyond the buffer's bounds, leading to undefined behavior.
code-sources: Entry point for user input is through `recv` on line 23 in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: Actions using user input are at `printf` on line 26 and `send` on line 29 in the `handle_client` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that after receiving data into the buffer, it is properly null-terminated. This prevents out-of-bounds reads by `strlen` and `printf` functions, thereby mitigating the risk of buffer overflow. Additionally, it corrects the buffer overflow condition by checking if `bytes_received` equals or exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`.
