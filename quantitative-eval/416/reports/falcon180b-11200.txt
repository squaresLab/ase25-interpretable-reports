    vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-11200 (severity: High)
    what: The code is vulnerable to buffer overflow when receiving data from a client. The function `recv` can receive more data than the size of the buffer, and this data is later broadcasted to connected clients without proper boundary checking.
    where: The vulnerability is located at line `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the function `handle_client` in the file `falcon180b-11200`.
    why: By not resolving this weakness, an attacker can exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, crash the server, or manipulate critical data, leading to a denial of service or other severe security consequences.
    how: An attacker can send more than 1024 bytes of data to the server, causing the `buffer` to overflow and potentially overwrite adjacent memory, which might include control structures like return addresses, thus gaining control over the program flow.
    code-sources: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
    code-sinks: `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix ensures that only `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes are read into the buffer, leaving space for a null terminator to prevent overflow. Adding `buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';` ensures the buffer is always null-terminated, preventing potential overflows and ensuring the integrity of the received data.
    method: UNKNOWN
