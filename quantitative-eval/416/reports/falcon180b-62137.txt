vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-62137 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `handle_client` function. When receiving data from the client using the `recv` function, it stores all bytes up to `BUFFER_SIZE` into the `buffer`, but it subsequently sends the entire `BUFFER_SIZE` worth of data to all other clients, potentially exceeding the actual amount of received data and leading to overflow.
where: Lines 21-33 in falcon180b-62137
why: A buffer overflow can lead to a range of serious issues, such as crashing the program, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code, or leading to unauthorized data access.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending more data than expected or malformed data to the server. This could lead to tampering with the state of adjacent memory, causing unexpected behavior or even allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
code-sources: The entry point is the `recv` function, which receives data from the client.
code-sinks: The sink is the `send` function, which sends data to other clients.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the issue by ensuring that the `send` function only sends the number of bytes that were actually received (`bytes_received`) instead of always sending `BUFFER_SIZE` worth of data. This prevents sending uninitialized or excess data, thus mitigating the buffer overflow risk.
