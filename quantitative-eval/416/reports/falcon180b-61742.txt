vuln-fix: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release (CWE-404) in falcon180b-61742 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of client socket descriptor when `pthread_create` is called in an iterative server design. If the client exits or any error occurs, client socket descriptors may not be correctly closed, possibly leading to resource exhaustion or undefined behavior.
where: Lines 60-64 in the `falcon180b-61742` file
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could lead to resource leakage where file descriptors are not properly closed, ultimately depleting the available file descriptors/system resources, potentially causing the server to crash or deny service to new clients (denial of service).
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to intentionally cause resource leakage by establishing multiple connections without closing them properly, thereby consuming resources and causing DoS.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the resource leakage issue by dynamically allocating memory for each client socket pointer passed to the `pthread_create` function. This ensures that the socket descriptor's value is preserved correctly across different threads, preventing the potential of undefined behavior or resource leakage.
