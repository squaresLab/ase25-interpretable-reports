    vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in falcon180b-41820 (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly handle the case where the `malloc` call in the `read_file` function fails, which could result in a NULL pointer dereference causing an out-of-bounds write.
    where: Lines 27-31 in falcon180b-41820.
    why: If the vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could potentially cause the application to crash or execute arbitrary code, leading to a denial of service or other malicious outcomes.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a file size large enough to cause the malloc call to fail due to insufficient memory, leading to a null pointer dereference.
    code-sources: Command-line arguments (argv[1]).
    code-sinks: Data copying using `memcpy` in the `read_file` function.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff checks if the `malloc` call fails by verifying if `f->data` is `NULL`. If it is, an error message is printed, and the function returns NULL to avoid dereferencing the NULL pointer.
    method: UNKNOWN
