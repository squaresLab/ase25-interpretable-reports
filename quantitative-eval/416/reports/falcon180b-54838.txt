vuln-fix: CWE-457: Use of Uninitialized Variable in falcon180b-54838 at handle_client function (severity: High)
what: The variable `client_socket` is dereferenced after the thread is created, causing potential concurrent access which can lead to undefined behavior. In this case, the pointer to `client_socket` passed to `pthread_create` can be modified before the thread function reads it.
where: Lines 16-33 in the file `falcon180b-54838` where the `handle_client` function is defined and the lines in `main` where threads are created wrapping the `handle_client` function.
why: If the weakness is not resolved, it can lead to undefined behavior, making the server unstable or vulnerable to exploits like race conditions.
how: An attacker could manipulate the timing, causing the main thread to overwrite `client_socket` before the new thread reads it. This may result in the wrong client socket being handled and leading to potential data leakage or corruption.
code-sources: The `recv` function call on line 20, handling external data from a connected client.
code-sinks: The `printf` call on line 22 and the `send` function on line 23, as they both use the `buffer` that can contain user input.

 ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures each client_thread receives its own `client_socket` by allocating memory for each new connection and passing a pointer to this allocated memory to `pthread_create`. This prevents concurrent modification of the `client_socket` value between threads.
