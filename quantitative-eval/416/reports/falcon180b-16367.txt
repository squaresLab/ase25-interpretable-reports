    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-16367 (severity: High)
    what: The code has a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `handle_client` function. Here, the `recv` function can read up to `sizeof(buffer)` bytes from the client into the `buffer`, but there's no guarantee that the data will be null-terminated, leading to potential buffer overflow scenarios when `printf` is used.
    where: The vulnerability is in the `handle_client` function in falcon180b-16367 at lines 12-25.
    why: If not resolved, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, crash the server, or exfiltrate sensitive information, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the application and potentially even the underlying system.
    how: An attacker can send a specially crafted payload to the server that causes the `recv` function to overwrite critical parts of the stack or heap, leading to unwanted behavior such as altering the control flow of the program or running arbitrary code.
    code-sources: The user input enters the application through the `recv` function on line 18.
    code-sinks: User input is printed to the console using `printf` on line 23.

    +    buffer[sizeof(buffer) - 1] = '\0';  // Ensure null termination
    +    printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
     }
     
     return NULL;
    ```

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the buffer is null-terminated by explicitly setting the last character of the buffer to `'\0'`. This prevents the buffer overflow when calling `printf`, which expects a null-terminated string.
    method: UNKNOWN
