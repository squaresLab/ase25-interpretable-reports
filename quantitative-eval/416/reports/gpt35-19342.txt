vuln-fix: Unbounded Write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gpt35-19342.c at lines 87, 89, 97 (severity: High)
what: The application performs buffer write operations without controlling the length of data written, risking buffer overflows.
where: Lines 87, 89, and 97 in gpt35-19342.c:
87: `scanf("%s", username);`
89: `scanf("%s", password);`
97: `scanf("%s", username);`
why: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities can result in arbitrary code execution, data corruption, and application crashes. This makes the application susceptible to exploitation which can compromise system integrity and confidentiality.
how: An attacker can input a username or password longer than the designated buffer size (50 characters), causing the program to write beyond the allocated space and potentially overwrite critical memory areas.
code-sources: Lines 87, 89, and 97 where user inputs for username and password are scanned without length checks.
code-sinks: The following operations use the user-provided inputs:
- Encrypting the password (line 21)
- Storing the password in a file (line 45)
- Retrieving and decrypting passwords from a file (lines 68, 73)
suggested-fix:

explanation-suggested-fix: The code changes ensure that the `scanf` function reads at most 49 characters for the username and password inputs, leaving room for the null terminator and thus preventing buffer overflows.
