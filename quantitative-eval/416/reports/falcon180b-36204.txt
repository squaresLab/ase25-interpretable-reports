    vuln-fix: Returning Stack-Allocated Memory (CWE-825) in falcon180b-36204:31 (severity: high)
    what: The `get_answer` function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated array `input` which becomes invalid once the function returns.
    where: The vulnerability is in the `get_answer` function, specifically at line 31 in falcon180b-36204.
    why: If not resolved, this could lead to undefined behavior such as crashes or incorrect program outputs due to the use of dangling pointers.
    how: An attacker might exploit this vulnerability by causing the program to behave unpredictably, potentially discovering ways to manipulate the program execution.
    code-sources: `get_answer()` function where user input is read using `fgets`.
    code-sinks: `get_answer()` function return value, which is used as input in the main function and in `check_answer()`.

    explanation-suggested-fix: This fix changes the `get_answer` function to accept a pre-allocated buffer and its size. Instead of returning a pointer to a local stack-allocated array, it uses a caller-provided buffer, ensuring the memory remains valid after the function returns. It also removes the newline character if present, improving the function's robustness.
