vuln-fix: Data race vulnerability (CWE-362) in falcon180b-67521 at multiple lines (severity: High)
what: The code has a data race condition caused by improper synchronization access to shared variables `bags_arrived` and `bags_handled`, which might lead to unpredictable behavior.
where: 
- Line 12: Initialization of mutex
- Line 21: Locking mutex 
- Line 24: Checking `bags_arrived`
- Line 29: Unlocking mutex
- Line 40: Locking mutex 
- Line 42: Incrementing `bags_arrived`
- Line 44: Unlocking mutex
why: If the data race is not resolved, two or more threads could simultaneously read and write to the same variables, causing inconsistencies and potential crashes in the application.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a scenario where multiple threads manipulate `bags_arrived` and `bags_handled` concurrently, potentially leading to incorrect program execution or crashes.
code-sources: `baggage_arrival(void *threadid)` initializes the threads in `main()` with the statement `pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, baggage_arrival, (void *) &i)`.
code-sinks: Actions performed within the `while (1)` loop in the `baggage_handler(void *threadid)` function and the `for` loop in the `baggage_arrival(void *threadid)` function.
suggested-fix:
```diff
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

#define NUM_BAGS 100
#define NUM_THREADS 5

int bags_arrived = 0;
int bags_handled = 0;

pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

void *baggage_handler(void *threadid) {
    int tid = *((int *) threadid);
    printf("Baggage Handler %d started\n", tid);

    while (1) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        if (bags_arrived == NUM_BAGS) {
            pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex); // Added unlock before exiting
            printf("Baggage Handler %d finished\n", tid);
            pthread_exit(NULL);
        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

        sleep(1);
    }
}

void *baggage_arrival(void *threadid) {
    int tid = *((int *) threadid);
    printf("Baggage Arrival %d started\n", tid);

    for (int i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
        bags_arrived++;
        printf("Baggage Arrival %d arrived with bag %d\n", tid, i);
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

        sleep(1);
    }
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    int thread_ids[NUM_THREADS]; // Added an array to hold thread ids

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        thread_ids[i] = i;
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, baggage_arrival, (void *) &thread_ids[i]);
    }

    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    return 0;
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff addresses the data race by ensuring mutex is unlocked before exiting the function if `bags_arrived` is equal to `NUM_BAGS`. Moreover, an array `thread_ids` is used to pass distinct thread IDs to each thread, preventing the issue of multiple threads using the same ID.
