    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-63336 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code contains improper synchronization when handling client connections leading to potential race conditions.
    where: Located in the function handle_client and accept_client within falcon180b-63336
    why: Failing to resolve this weakness can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or unauthorized access, potentially compromising the security and stability of the server.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering race conditions that could potentially disrupt the service, cause incorrect processing of client data, or even lead to unauthorized access to other client connections.
    code-sources: User input enters the application via the recv function in handle_client.
    code-sinks: The user input is processed and printed out via the printf function in handle_client.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by introducing a mutex, `clients_mutex`, to protect access to the shared resource `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable. By locking the mutex before modifying these shared resources and unlocking it afterwards, we ensure that these modifications are carried out atomically, preventing race conditions.
    method: UNKNOWN
