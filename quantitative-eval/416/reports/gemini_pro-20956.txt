    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in gemini_pro-20956 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a race condition in the server code due to improper synchronization when adding a client socket to the client sockets array.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function and the `handle_client` function, specifically at the points where the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed and modified.
    why: A potential consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker could exploit the race condition to cause resource corruption, leading to undefined behavior, potential crashes, or even controlled code execution.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting to and disconnecting from the server. This rapid sequence of operations can create a scenario where multiple threads simultaneously modify the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent state and possible security breaches.
    code-sources: User input enters the application primarily through the `accept` system call in the `main` function, which creates a new client socket.
    code-sinks: The application performs actions using the user input in the `recv` function within the `handle_client` function, where the buffer can be overflown, leading to potential further exploits.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff introduces dynamic allocation of memory for each client socket, ensuring that each thread gets its own copy and preventing race conditions. The fix includes freeing the dynamically allocated memory after use to prevent memory leaks.
