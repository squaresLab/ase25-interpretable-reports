vuln-fix: CWE-839: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-60732 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is an attempt to access the `clients` array without bounds checking, potentially causing a buffer overflow when an index beyond the size of the array is accessed.
where: Line 66 in falcon180b-60732
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability could result in undefined behavior including potential corruption of adjacent memory, leading to crashes or more severe exploits such as arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker could exploit this by forcing multiple connections until the `clients` array is accessed beyond its valid range. This could lead to writing outside its boundary, thus potentially allowing for memory corruption.
code-sources: Network input from client connections via the `accept` function in the main loop.
code-sinks: The assignment `clients[i] = client_socket_fd;` at Line 66 where the array index could overflow.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix includes bounds checking on the `clients` array index before assigning a new client socket. This check ensures the loop does not go out of bounds and attempts to access or modify invalid memory locations.
