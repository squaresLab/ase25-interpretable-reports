vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in falcon180b-61869:21-33 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition vulnerability in line 31, where the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed and modified by multiple threads without proper synchronization.
where: Lines 21-33, file falcon180b-61869
why: If this race condition is not resolved, it can lead to corrupted data, unexpected behavior, or crashes of the server, ultimately compromising the integrity and availability of the system.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple connection requests simultaneously, causing the race condition. This can lead to inconsistencies and potential crashes.
code-sources: The entry point is `accept` function in `accept_connections()` function.
code-sinks: The vulnerable action occurs when the application assigns and increments `client_sockets[num_clients]` and `num_clients` within the `accept_connections()` function.
suggested-fix:

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex lock around the critical section where `client_sockets` and `num_clients` are accessed in the `accept_connections` function. This ensures that these shared resources are not accessed simultaneously by multiple threads, thus eliminating the race conditions.
