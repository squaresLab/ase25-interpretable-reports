vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in falcon180b-64595 (severity: High)
what: The code suffers from an out-of-bounds write due to a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `handle_client` function.
where: Lines with the `recv` function call inside the `handle_client` function in falcon180b-64595.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, an attacker could send specially crafted data to overflow the buffer `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]`, potentially overwriting adjacent memory, leading to arbitrary code execution or crashing the server.
how: An attacker could send a message that is larger than `BUFFER_SIZE-1` characters without a null-terminator, causing the buffer in the `handle_client` function to overflow.
code-sources: The `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The data being printed out using `printf` and subsequently used to control the execution flow within the `handle_client` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff reduces the buffer size by 1 in the `recv` function call to leave room for a null-terminator. After receiving the data, the buffer is expressly null-terminated to prevent out-of-bounds memory access or overwrite.
method: UNKNOWN
