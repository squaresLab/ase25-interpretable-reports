vuln-fix: Command Injection (CWE-78) in falcon180b-9941 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a command injection vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands.
where: This vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function in the line where `system("echo 0 > /dev/ttyACM0")` and `system("echo 1 > /dev/ttyACM0")` are called, in the file falcon180b-9941.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, an attacker could gain unauthorized control over the host system, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or system compromise.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted input to the server that includes additional commands or metacharacters to be executed by the `system` function, resulting in arbitrary command execution on the server.
code-sources: The entry point is in the `accept_connections` function where user input is received via the `accept` function and passed to the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input are in `handle_client` function, specifically in the `system` function calls.

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix replaces the unsafe `system` calls with safer file handling operations using `fopen`, `fprintf`, and `fclose`. This avoids the possibility of command injection by removing the reliance on shell command execution and directly writing to the device file.
