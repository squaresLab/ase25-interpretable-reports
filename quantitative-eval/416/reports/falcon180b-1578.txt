vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-1578 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `handle_client` function. Specifically, the `buffer` array allocated on the stack has a fixed size of 1024 bytes, but `recv` can write up to 1024 bytes into `buffer` without null-terminating it. Subsequent use of `strlen(buffer)` in `send` can lead to out-of-bounds access.
where: Line numbers in falcon180b-1578 for function `handle_client`:
```c
void *handle_client(void *arg) {
    int client_socket = *(int *) arg;
    char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];

    while (1) {
        memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);

        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            break;
        }

        printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
        for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) {
            if (clients[i]!= client_socket) {
                send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
            }
        }
    }

    close(client_socket);
    return NULL;
}
```
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could send a specially crafted message that leads to buffer overflow, potentially causing a program crash, allowing arbitrary code execution or other undesired behavior.
how: An attacker would send a message exceeding the buffer size to overflow the `buffer` variable and potentially execute arbitrary code or crash the server.
code-sources: 
- The `recv` function call in `handle_client` function.
```c
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
```
- The `accept` function call in `main`:
```c
int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);
```
code-sinks: 
- The `send` function call within the for loop in `handle_client`:
```c
send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
```

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff resolves the buffer overflow vulnerability by ensuring the buffer is explicitly null-terminated after data is received from `recv`. Additionally, it changes the `printf` function to use a length-limited format to avoid reading beyond the received message length.
method: UNKNOWN
