vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-46356 (severity: High)
what: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow because it does not properly check the size of the input data against the buffer's size before copying it.
where: Line 42 in the function `handle_client` within file `falcon180b-46356`
why: Not resolving this weakness could allow an attacker to overflow the buffer, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or enabling arbitrary code execution which can compromise the entire system.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload larger than `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` to overflow the `buffer` array, potentially overwriting important control structures or code paths in memory.
code-sources: The `recv` function call at line 38 is the primary entry point where user input enters the application.
code-sinks: The `send` function call within the for loop starting at line 42 uses the data directly received from the client.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds a null-terminator to the buffer to ensure it is properly terminated after receiving data. Additionally, it modifies the `printf` and `send` function calls to use the precise byte length received instead of relying on the null-terminated string functions, thereby preventing buffer overflow and uncontrolled data usage.
