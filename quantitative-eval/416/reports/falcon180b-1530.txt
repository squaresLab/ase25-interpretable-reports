    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-1530 (severity: critical)
    what: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow due to the use of `strlen` on the buffer that has been received from the client without proper validation of its size.
    where: Lines 22-28 in the function `handle_client` in the file falcon180b-1530.
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit it to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system or crashing the server.
    how: An attacker would send a specially crafted message larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` to overflow the buffer and potentially overwrite critical variables or control data.
    code-sources: The `recv` function call at line 21.
    code-sinks: The `send` function call at line 27 and the `printf` function call at line 23.
    suggested-fix: 
    ```diff
    22c22
    < char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    ---
    > char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE + 1];  // +1 for the null terminator
    26c26
    < printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
    ---
    > buffer[BUFFER_SIZE] = '\0';  // Ensure null-termination
    > printf("Client %d sent: %.1024s\n", client_socket, buffer);  // Limit the output to BUFFER_SIZE
    27c27
    < send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
    ---
    > send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strnlen(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE), 0);
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix extends the buffer size by 1 to accommodate the null terminator and ensures that strings are null-terminated to prevent overflow. The `printf` is modified to limit the maximum length of the output to the buffer size. The `send` function is changed to use `strnlen` to ensure the length does not exceed `BUFFER_SIZE`.
    method: UNKNOWN
