vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in gemini_pro-34590 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a race condition that arises due to improper synchronization between the threads. Specifically, the main thread locks the mutex and waits for the condition variable signal, which can occur before the main thread actually starts waiting.
where: The vulnerability is located in the gemini_pro-34590 file, lines 27-29 (pthread_create and subsequent waiting logic).
why: An attacker exploiting this race condition can cause undefined behavior, potentially leading to incorrect calculations, application crashes, or more severe security issues if further exploitable logic is added.
how: An attacker could cause the main thread to miss the signal from the worker thread due to the timing of the execution. This results in the main thread waiting indefinitely on `pthread_cond_wait`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes resolve the vulnerability by ensuring that the main thread safely and correctly waits for the condition variable signal from the worker thread. By adding proper unlocking of the mutex before waiting and incorporating a while loop to recheck the condition, we prevent the race condition where the signal could be missed because the main thread wasn't yet waiting.
