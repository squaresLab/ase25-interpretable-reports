    vuln-fix: Use of Uninitialized Variable (CWE-457) in falcon180b-12409 at line 70 (severity: High)
    what: The variable `thread_id` is declared but not used correctly after pthread_create. This may result in undefined behavior or potential issues with thread management.
    where: The vulnerability is located at lines 70-72 in the file falcon180b-12409.
    why: Not resolving this issue can result in potential race conditions or improper handling of threads, leading to application crashes or unpredictable behavior.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple requests that could create an undefined number of threads, which may be mismanaged due to this incorrect usage, potentially causing a denial of service.
    code-sources: The entry points in the code where user input enters the application are:
    - `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` in `handle_request` function.
    - `accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *)&client_addr, &client_addr_size)` in the `main` function.
    code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input from the source are:
    - `send(clients[i].socket, buffer, bytes_received, 0)` in the `handle_request` function.
    suggested-fix:

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change ensures that the created thread is detached by using `pthread_detach(thread_id)`, which allows the thread's resources to be automatically released upon termination, avoiding potential resource leaks and ensuring proper thread management.
