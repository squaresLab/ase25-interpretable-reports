vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-44235 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability involves receiving data from a client into a fixed-size buffer without proper validation or bounds checking. The function `recv` reads up to `BUFFER_SIZE` bytes into `buffer`, which is then passed to `printf` and `send`. If the data received exceeds the expected size or is malformed, the buffer can be overflowed, leading to undefined behavior including potential control over the program's execution.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `thread_function` in falcon180b-44235, specifically at:
- Line 17: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
- Line 24: `send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker can exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking control of the entire system or causing it to crash.
how: An attacker would send a payload exceeding `BUFFER_SIZE` to overflow the `buffer`. This could lead to overwriting the stack, where hijacking the return address is possible. Further manipulation could allow the execution of malicious code.
code-sources: The `recv` function call on line 17 is the entry point where data from the client is read into the buffer.
code-sinks: The `send` function call on line 24 and the `printf` call on line 21 are the sinks where the data in the buffer is used and can cause harm.

explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff limits the buffer size read by `recv` to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` and ensures proper null-termination, thereby mitigating the risk of buffer overflow. Additionally, the `recv` and `send` operations are checked for errors, improving robustness. The `setsockopt` is added to allow the server to quickly restart after termination.
