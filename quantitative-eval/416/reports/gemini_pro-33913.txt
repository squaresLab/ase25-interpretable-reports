vuln-fix: CWE-119: Buffer Overflow in gemini_pro-33913 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the way the filename is received and handled by the `recv` function without proper bounds checking. Specifically, `filename` is defined with a fixed size of `BUFFER_SIZE` (1024 bytes), but there is no check to ensure that the received data does not exceed this size.
where: Vulnerability is located in the `thread_func` function, specifically at the line:
```C
int bytes_received = recv(sockfd, filename, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
```
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service (crash), or data corruption as an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to overwrite important memory structures.
how: An attacker can send a specially crafted filename that exceeds the `BUFFER_SIZE` limit. This will overwrite adjacent memory locations in the `filename` buffer, which can then be used to execute malicious code or crash the application.
code-sources: The entry point is the `recv` function call in the `thread_func` function, which receives user input (the filename) from the client.
code-sinks: The received filename is then passed to the `scan_file` function.
suggested-fix:

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that if the received data length exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`, the function logs an error and exits gracefully, mitigating the risk of buffer overflow. Additionally, it adds a null terminator at the end of the received data to prevent reading invalid memory beyond the buffer.
