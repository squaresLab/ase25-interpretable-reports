vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-37232 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability in the `handle_client` function, where the `num_clients` variable is incremented and decremented without proper synchronization mechanisms, leading to potential inconsistent state.
where: The vulnerable lines are `int client_socket = *(int *) arg;` and `num_clients++;` in the main function and `num_clients--;` in the `handle_client` function in the file falcon180b-37232.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it may lead to an inconsistent count of connected clients, potential overflows, or other unexpected behaviors, possibly resulting in denial of service or data corruption.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting multiple clients to create a situation where `num_clients` does not reflect the actual number of connected clients, leading to potential resource exhaustion or incorrect handling of new client connections.
code-sources: The entry point for user inputs is through the `recv` call in the `handle_client` function. The client's input data is stored in the `buffer`.
code-sinks: The sink is the `send` call within the `handle_client` function, which sends the user's input data back to the client.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to protect access to the `num_clients` variable, ensuring that increments and decrements to this variable are performed atomically, thus preventing race conditions.
