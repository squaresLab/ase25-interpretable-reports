    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-7503 (severity: Critical)
    what: The code does not appropriately handle buffer boundaries in the `recv` function. This can lead to a buffer overflow when receiving data from a client.
    where: In the function `handle_client`, lines involving `recv` and `send` methods for client communication.
    why: If not resolved, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash the application, execute arbitrary code, or overwrite sensitive information leading to severe security breaches.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a carefully crafted payload exceeding the buffer size limit. This can overwrite the adjacent memory and potentially control the execution flow of the application.
    code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
    code-sinks: `send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures proper null termination of the buffer if the received data size is equal to or greater than the buffer size. This prevents buffer overflows by maintaining string boundaries and validates the amount of data being sent back to the client, avoiding potential overflows.
