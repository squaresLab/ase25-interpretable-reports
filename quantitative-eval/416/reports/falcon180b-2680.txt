vuln-fix: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-2680 (severity: High)
what: The buffer used to store received data in the function `handle_client` can be overflowed because `recv` can read up to `MAX_LINE` bytes, but `send` uses `strlen(buffer)` for the number of bytes to send, leading to potential stack-based buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the file falcon180b-2680 at lines 39-45.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, an attacker could crash the application, execute arbitrary code, or escalate privileges by manipulating the buffer content.
how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by sending a large payload, close to `MAX_LINE` in size, to the server which will then cause an overflow since the termination condition is based on `strlen` instead of the actual `bytes_received`.
code-sources: The user input enters the application through the `recv` call in the `handle_client` function at line 42.
code-sinks: The user input is then processed and sent back using the `send` call in the `handle_client` function at line 45.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff modifies the `send` call to use `bytes_received` instead of `strlen(buffer)` which ensures that only the number of bytes actually received are echoed back to the client. This prevents the stack-based buffer overflow by avoiding overrunning the buffer boundaries.
