vuln-fix: Use of potentially unsafe function 'strcpy' (CWE-676) in falcon180b-3290 (severity: High)
what: The code uses `strcpy` to manage the data received from a client within a buffer in the `handle_client` function without verifying if the data fits within the buffer size.
where: falcon180b-3290 at the line with `recv(client_socket_copy, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
why: An attacker could overflow the buffer by sending data larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`, potentially overwriting adjacent memory, leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a payload larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` (1024 bytes) to trigger a buffer overflow.
code-sources: The user input enters the application at `recv(client_socket_copy, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`.
code-sinks: The received data is used in multiple places: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket_copy, buffer);` and `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`
suggested-fix: 
```diff
@@ -19,6 +19,8 @@ void *handle_client(void *client_socket) {
        memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket_copy, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);

-        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
+        if (bytes_received <= 0 || bytes_received >= BUFFER_SIZE) {
+            printf("Buffer overflow attempt detected\n");
            break;
        }

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff prevents buffer overflow by checking if the number of bytes received is greater than or equal to `BUFFER_SIZE` and logging the event before terminating the loop. This mitigates the risk of using a buffer that's too large and prevents memory corruption.
method: UNKNOWN
