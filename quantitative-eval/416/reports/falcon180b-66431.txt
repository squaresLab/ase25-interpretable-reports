    vuln-fix: Command Injection (CWE-78) in falcon180b-66431 (severity: High)
    what: The code directly uses user input in the `system` function without proper sanitization or validation.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at the lines:
    ```C
    if (strncmp(buffer, "on", 3) == 0) {
        system("echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness");
    } else if (strncmp(buffer, "off", 4) == 0) {
        system("echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness");
    }
    ```
    why: An attacker could inject malicious commands, causing arbitrary code execution on the server. This weakness could lead to severe security breaches, including unauthorized access, data theft, or complete system compromise.
    how: An attacker could send specially crafted data that includes shell commands. For example, sending "on; rm -rf /" would execute the command to turn on the LED and then delete all files on the system, leading to data loss.
    code-sources: The primary entry point for user input is through the `recv` function call:
    ```C
    int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
    ```
    code-sinks: The `system` function is where the provided user input is potentially causing harm:
    ```C
    if (strncmp(buffer, "on", 3) == 0) {
        system("echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness");
    } else if (strncmp(buffer, "off", 4) == 0) {
        system("echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/led1/brightness");
    }
    ```

     }
    
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff eliminates the use of the `system` function, which is vulnerable to command injection. Instead, it uses `fopen` and `fprintf` to safely write to the LED brightness control file. This ensures the input is not executed as a shell command.
    method: UNKNOWN
