vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in falcon180b-4688 at line 77 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to an unbounded write operation in the `backup_thread` function while handling the `dest_file` variable.
where: The vulnerability is located at line 77 in the file falcon180b-4688.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, it can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to execute malicious code on the system, potentially causing a complete system compromise.
how: An attacker may exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted filename as input, causing the strcat function to exceed the bounds of the `dest_file` buffer and overwrite adjacent memory.
code-sources: The entry point in the code where user input enters is at line 69: `scanf("%s", source_file);`.
code-sinks: The action performed by the application using user input from a source is at line 77 in the `strcat(dest_file, source_file);`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by using `snprintf` instead of `strcat` to ensure that the destination buffer `dest_file` is not overflowed. The use of `strncpy` and `snprintf` ensures that the string operations respect the buffer size limits, preventing buffer overflow.
