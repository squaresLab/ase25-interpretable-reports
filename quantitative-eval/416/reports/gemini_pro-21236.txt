    vuln-fix: cpp/return-stack-allocated-memory (CWE-825) and cpp/unbounded-write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gemini_pro-21236 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains two critical vulnerabilities: returning a pointer to a stack-allocated buffer and potential buffer overflow due to unbounded writes.
    where: The vulnerabilities occur in gemini_pro-21236 at lines 53-54.
    why: If not resolved, these vulnerabilities can lead to undefined behavior, including application crashes and potential arbitrary code execution, compromising the security of the system.
    how: An attacker can exploit the buffer overflow by inputting a string longer than 64 characters, causing a stack-based buffer overflow. The use of a dangling pointer by returning a stack-allocated memory can lead to undefined behavior and program crashes.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `scanf` function in the `getAnswer` function.
    code-sinks: The user input is used in the `checkAnswer` function for the comparison with the correct answer and is returned directly from the `getAnswer` function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The code fix involves changing the `getAnswer` function to accept a buffer pointer and its size as arguments. This prevents returning a pointer to a stack-allocated buffer and mitigates buffer overflow by using `fgets` to read the user input, which safeguards against writing beyond the allocated buffer size.
