    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-6268 at lines 12, 17, 22 (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly limit the amount of data copied into `request`, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
    where: In the `handle_client` function in falcon180b-6268 at lines 12, 17, 22.
    why: An attacker can exploit this weakness to crash the application, execute arbitrary code or cause a denial-of-service (DoS).
    how: An attacker could send a very large request to the application, overflowing the `request` buffer and potentially modifying memory.
    code-sources: The recv() function on line 17 in handle_client.
    code-sinks: The `request` buffer on line 12 in handle_client.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the incoming request data is null-terminated by reducing the size by one byte in the `recv` function and explicitly setting the last byte to `\0`. This change prevents buffer overflow by not allowing more data than the allocated buffer size and ensures a null terminator even if the maximum amount of data is received.
    method: UNKNOWN
