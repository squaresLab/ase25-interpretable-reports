vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-48091 (severity: High)
what: The application has a potential race condition because the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable are shared between threads, but not properly synchronized.
where: From line 23 (function handle_client) to line 79 (end of main function).
why: If not resolved, the race condition can cause undefined behavior, including data corruption, crashes, or security vulnerabilities such as an attacker taking control of the application.
how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by simultaneously connecting multiple clients to the server, causing the `num_clients` variable to be incremented incorrectly. This could result in wrong indexing into the `clients` array, leading to various forms of instability or control over the application.
code-sources: Entry point is the client connections accepted at `accept` function call in line 61.
code-sinks: Actions using shared data `clients` array and `num_clients` variable, especially around the `pthread_create` function in line 73.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: Adding `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` around accesses to the `num_clients` variable ensures that only one thread can modify `num_clients` at a time, preventing race conditions. The newly introduced `pthread_mutex_t clients_mutex` is initialized once and thus used for synchronization.
