vuln-fix: Unbounded Write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gemini_pro-1786 (severity: Critical)
what: The function `sprintf` is used without controlling the length of the data written to the buffer `message`. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the content of `buffer` is larger than `message`'s capacity.
where: Line 35 in gemini_pro-1786
why: If this issue is not resolved, it can result in a buffer overflow, leading to potential data corruption, unexpected behavior, or even remote code execution by an attacker.
how: An attacker could manipulate the input to include a large amount of data with the suspicious keywords "DROP", "DELETE", or "TRUNCATE". This could overflow the buffer `message` when `sprintf` copies the data, potentially overwriting sensitive memory locations and injecting malicious code or crashing the system.
code-sources: The source of user input is the socket read call in the `handle_client` function: `int n = read(newsockfd, buffer, sizeof(buffer));`.
code-sinks: The sink is the `sprintf` call in the `handle_client` function: `sprintf(message, "Suspicious activity detected: %s", buffer);`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix changes the `sprintf` call to `snprintf`, which limits the number of characters copied to the size of the `message` buffer (512 bytes). This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring that the written data does not exceed the buffer's capacity.
