    vuln-fix: CWE-134: Uncontrolled Format String in falcon180b-28048 (severity: high)
    what: The vulnerability is an uncontrolled format string issue where unsanitized user input is passed directly as a format string to a printf() function.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at the line with `printf("%s\n", buffer);`.
    why: If this weakness is not resolved, an attacker could execute arbitrary code, read sensitive memory content, or cause a segmentation fault leading to denial-of-service.
    how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted string to the server. This string could contain format specifiers that, when processed by printf, could allow the attacker to read arbitrary memory or crash the program.
    code-sources: The user input enters the application via the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: The vulnerable action is performed by the `printf` function in the `handle_client` function using the user input stored in the `buffer` array.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested change replaces the `printf` function call with `fputs`. Using `fputs` helps avoid format string vulnerabilities because it treats the user input as a simple string and does not interpret any format specifiers.
