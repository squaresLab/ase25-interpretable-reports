vuln-fix: CWE-665: Improper Initialization in falcon180b-53797 (severity: High)
what: The code contains an improper initialization issue where the client sockets array `client_sockets[]` and thread IDs array `thread_ids[]` are not appropriately managed, potentially causing mismatches in thread handling and socket communication.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function and the `main` function.
why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to disrupt server operation, cause denial-of-service, or execute arbitrary code by injecting rogue clients into the serverâ€™s communication system.
how: An attacker could repeatedly connect and disconnect clients to exhaust the server's resources, leading to potential mismatches in the `client_sockets` array, which could result in sending sensitive data to the wrong sockets or server crash.
code-sources: The entry point where user input enters the application is in `accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);` inside the `main` function.
code-sinks: Key actions performed include `recv(sock, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in `handle_client` and `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` inside the for-loop of `handle_client`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex `pthread_mutex_t client_sockets_mutex` to ensure proper synchronization when accessing and modifying `client_sockets` and `num_clients`. This prevents race conditions and ensures consistent state management for `client_sockets` array and the `num_clients` counter. Additionally, the client removal logic is added to safely update `client_sockets` when a client disconnects.
