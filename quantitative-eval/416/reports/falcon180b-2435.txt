    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-2435 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code involves improper synchronization in handling the addition of client sockets and the increment of the number of clients.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function, specifically around the lines where `num_clients` is incremented and `client_socket` is assigned to `client_sockets`.
    why: Not resolving this weakness could lead to race conditions, where multiple threads might simultaneously modify shared data, potentially crashing the server or leading to inconsistent states.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to connect multiple clients to the server simultaneously or in rapid succession, causing race conditions and unpredictable behavior in the application.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `accept` function that accepts client connections and `recv` function that receives data from connected clients. 
    code-sinks: The `printf` function that outputs received data, and the `send` function that forwards the data to other clients.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: This code diff introduces a mutex (`client_mutex`) to ensure mutual exclusion when accessing and modifying shared variables (`num_clients` and `client_sockets`). This prevents race conditions between threads handling client connections.
