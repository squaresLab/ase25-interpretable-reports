vuln-fix: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation in falcon180b-2609 lines 64-82 (severity: High)
what: The application does not properly validate the length of the messages received, which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
where: Lines 64-82, inside the `main` function where `recv` is used to read data into `buffer`.
why: If the weakness is not resolved, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code, leading to a potential compromise of the entire system.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message larger than the `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH` limit, leading to buffer overflow and potential execution of arbitrary code.
code-sources: The `recv` function call at line 70 which reads data into `buffer` using user input.
code-sinks: The `broadcast_message` function that sends data from `buffer` using `send`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix adjusts the `recv` function to read at most `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH - 1` bytes, reserving space for the null-terminator `\0`. It then ensures the buffer is null-terminated by setting `buffer[bytes_received] = '\0';` This prevents buffer overflow and ensures safe string operations.
