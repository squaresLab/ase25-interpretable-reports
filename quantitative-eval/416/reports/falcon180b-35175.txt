    vuln-fix: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in falcon180b-35175 (severity: High)
    what: The code potentially allows an integer overflow in the `num_clients` management, potentially leading to buffer overflow and improper resource management.
    where: Lines managing `num_clients` variable increment and usage in the main `while` loop and `client_socket` initialization.
    why: Without resolving this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially overflow the `clients` array, causing crashes or possibly code execution vulnerabilities by exceeding the maximum array length.
    how: An attacker could send a large number of connection requests to the server, causing `num_clients` to exceed `MAX_CLIENTS` and lead to undefined behavior.
    code-sources: Entry point: `int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);` in `main`.
    code-sinks: Action: `clients[num_clients] = client_socket; num_clients++;` in `main`.
    suggested-fix:

    explanation-suggested-fix: This change prevents `num_clients` from exceeding `MAX_CLIENTS` by resetting the `num_clients` value to `MAX_CLIENTS` to avoid overflow scenarios. This ensures the buffer and resources will not be improperly used beyond their allocated size.
