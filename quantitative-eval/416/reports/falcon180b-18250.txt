    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-18250 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a race condition in the way it handles new client connections. Specifically, multiple threads can write to the `client_socket` variable that is passed to `pthread_create`, leading to an unsafe condition.
    where: The vulnerability is found at the lines where a new thread is created in the `main` function. This is particularly at the line `pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);`.
    why: A race condition in this context could lead to some client connections being handled incorrectly. This could cause data corruption, crashes, or unauthorized access to data of other clients.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making many connection attempts in a very short span of time, leading the server to create multiple threads that could race to handle these connections. This could cause the server to mishandle the socket connections.
    code-sources: Entry point is the `accept` call in the `main` function where client connections are initially accepted.
    code-sinks: The `recv` and `send` calls in the `handle_client` function are the main sinks where data received from and sent to the client are handled.

```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves adding a mutex lock (`client_lock`) to protect the shared resource `num_clients` and `clients` array. This ensures that threads have mutually exclusive access to these resources when they are being modified, preventing race conditions.
