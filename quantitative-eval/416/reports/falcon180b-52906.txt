    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-52906 at line 15 (severity: High)
    what: The code lacks proper bounds checking on array indices, which can result in accessing or modifying data outside the intended bounds of buffer arrays.
    where: The buffer overflow vulnerability is present at line 15, in the handle_client function within the file falcon180b-52906.
    why: Failing to resolve this weakness may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially compromising the system and its data.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted data that exceeds the BUFFER_SIZE, causing a buffer overflow and potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    code-sources: The potential entry point for user input is recv() function call at line 15 in the handle_client() function.
    code-sinks: The user input buffer is accessed at lines 21 and 24 in the same function handle_client().

                 }
             }

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the buffer is properly null-terminated, which prevents buffer overflow by ensuring that any received data is confined within the allocated buffer size.
