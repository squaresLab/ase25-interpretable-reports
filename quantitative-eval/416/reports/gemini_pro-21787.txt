vuln-fix: Unbounded Write (CWE-787) in gemini_pro-21787 at line 43 (severity: High)
what: The code allows for writing to a buffer without checking if the input fits within the allocated buffer size. This can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
where: The vulnerability is located in file gemini_pro-21787 at line 43: `strcpy(clients[i].name, name);`.
why: An unbounded write can allow an attacker to overflow the buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or corruption of adjacent memory.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message containing a very long name. If the length of the name exceeds 256 characters, it will overflow the `name` buffer, leading to memory corruption or program crash.
code-sources: The user input enters the application through the socket, read in the `handle_client` function at line 16.
code-sinks: The actions performed using the input are at line 43 where the `strcpy` function writes the input name to the `name` member of `client_t`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix uses `strncpy` instead of `strcpy` to limit the number of characters copied to the buffer, avoiding buffer overflow. Additionally, ensuring null-termination by explicitly setting `clients[i].name[sizeof(clients[i].name) - 1]` to `'\0'` guarantees that the buffer is properly terminated.
