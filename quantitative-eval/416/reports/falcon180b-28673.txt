    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-28673 (severity: Medium)
    what: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow in the `recv` and `send` calls within the `handle_client` function. Unsanitized input data received from a client could overflow the buffer and affect the program's behavior or integrity.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in the following lines:
    ```c
    if (recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0) <= 0) {
        break;
    }
    send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
    ```
    why: If not resolved, this weakness could be exploited to crash the server or execute arbitrary code, compromising the system's security and potentially leading to data loss or unauthorized system access.
    how: An attacker could overflow the buffer by sending more data than the buffer can hold, causing a segmentation fault or enabling the execution of malicious code.
    code-sources: The entry points in the code where user input enters the application are the `recv` calls in the `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input are the `printf` and `send` calls in the `handle_client` function.

         close(client_socket);
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fixes ensure that the buffer is always null-terminated after receiving data to prevent buffer overflows and ensure safe string operations. The change also updates the `send` call to use the actual number of bytes received instead of relying on `strlen`, which assumes a null-terminated string.
