vuln-fix: Concurrent Access to Shared Resource (CWE-362) in falcon180b-4505 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition vulnerability. The `clients` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed by multiple threads without synchronization, leading to potential concurrent access issues.
where: The vulnerability is located at lines where `clients` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed and modified in the `handle_client` function and main loop.
why: If the vulnerability is not resolved, it could lead to unpredictable behavior, data corruption, or crashes due to inconsistent access to shared resource. Potentially, an attacker might exploit this to cause denial of service.
how: An attacker might open multiple connections to the server simultaneously, leading to race conditions when updating the `clients` array or `num_clients` variable. This can result in data corruption or application crash, causing denial of service.
code-sources: The entry point is the `accept` function in the main loop, which accepts connections from clients (line: in the main function).
code-sinks: Actions performed using user input are the `send` function calls in the `handle_client` function, where messages are broadcast to other clients (lines: in the handle_client function).

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix uses a mutex (`pthread_mutex_t clients_mutex`) to synchronize access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By locking the mutex before accessing these shared resources and unlocking it afterwards, we ensure that only one thread can modify these resources at a time, thus preventing race conditions.
