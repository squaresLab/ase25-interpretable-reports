vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-13115 (severity: High)
what: A buffer overflow vulnerability occurs because the code does not properly validate the length of the data being received and then sent back to the client. Specifically, the length parameter passed to `send` is determined by the return value of `strlen(buffer)`, which assumes `buffer` contains a null-terminated string. If `recv` receives non-null-terminated data of large size, subsequent code using `strlen(buffer)` can result in reading beyond the bounds of the allocated `buffer`, leading to potential buffer overflow.
where: In the handle_client function in falcon180b-13115
why: If this vulnerability is exploited, an attacker may be able to overwrite memory, causing the application to crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker would connect to the server and send large, carefully crafted payloads that do not include null terminators within the size limit of `BUF_SIZE`. This can cause the server to read and send back memory outside the intended buffer, potentially leading to memory corruption.
code-sources: Entry points where user input enters the application:
- `accept` in `main`, line 42
- `recv` in `handle_client`, line 18

code-sinks: Actions performed by the application, using user input from a source:
- `send` in `handle_client`, line 22

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff changes the length parameter in the `send` function from `strlen(buffer)` to `bytes_received`. This ensures that the length of the data being sent back is always equal to the number of bytes received, preventing any potential buffer overflow by ensuring we do not read outside the bounds of the buffer.
