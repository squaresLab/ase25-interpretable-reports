vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-20909 (severity: high)
what: The vulnerability is a race condition resulting from shared access to the `client_socket` variable in `main` and `handle_client` without proper synchronization.
where: Lines involving `client_socket`, specifically its use in `main` when passed to `pthread_create` and its handling in `handle_client`.
why: This weakness can cause undefined behavior, including data corruption or crashes if multiple threads access and modify `client_socket` concurrently.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly establishing multiple connections, causing the shared `client_socket` variable to be overwritten. This could lead to improper handling of client connections, including potential crashes or security breaches.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `accept` call in the `main` function that accepts client connections.
code-sinks: The `recv` function in `handle_client` which processes incoming data from the client sockets.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff eliminates the race condition by dynamically allocating memory for each `client_socket` before passing it to the `pthread_create` function. Each thread will then free this memory after closing its respective `client_socket`, ensuring that each thread operates on a distinct socket descriptor.
