    vuln-fix: CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound in gemini_pro-29412 (severity: High)
    what: The code fails to validate user input for potential overflows, particularly when performing shift operations.
    where: Lines involving `scanf` and shift operations (line 14, line 24-45) in gemini_pro-29412.
    why: If integer overflow occurs during shift operations, it could lead to undefined behavior, potentially crashing the program or leading to security vulnerabilities.
    how: An attacker could supply a very large value for `shift`, causing an integer overflow. This overflow could potentially be leveraged to execute arbitrary code or crash the program, leading to denial of service.
    code-sources: `scanf("%u", &n);` at line 20, `scanf("%u", &m);` at line 22, `scanf("%d", &shift);` at line 37 and line 43.
    code-sinks: `n << shift;` at line 41, `n >> shift;` at line 47.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds checks to ensure the user-provided `choice` is within the valid range of operations (1 to 6). Additionally, it checks that the `shift` value is non-negative and does not exceed the bit-width of an `unsigned int` to prevent overflow.
