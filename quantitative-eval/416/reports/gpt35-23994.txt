vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gpt35-23994, line 69 (severity: High)
what: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `scanf` call for reading the expense description.
where: Line 69 in the file gpt35-23994.
why: If an attacker provides a description longer than the allocated buffer, it could lead to buffer overflow, causing undefined behavior, potential data corruption, or even code execution.
how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by providing a description longer than 50 characters. This would overflow the `description` buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
code-sources: `scanf("%s", description);` in line 69.
code-sinks: The buffer `description` in the struct `Expense` could be overwritten by user input.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: By changing `scanf("%s", description);` to `scanf("%49s", description);`, we ensure that the input does not exceed the allocated 50 bytes buffer (49 characters plus the terminating null character). This prevents buffer overflow.
