vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-59834 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function due to the potential for receiving more data than the size of the buffer `buffer[BUFFER_SIZE]`.
where: In the function `handle_client`, specifically at `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`.
why: Not resolving this weakness could allow an attacker to overwrite memory, leading to potential code execution, crashing the program, or causing denial of service attacks.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a very large message, which exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`, causing a buffer overflow and potentially allowing the attacker to inject malicious code.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The immediate use of the received user input occurs in the `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` line.

 ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the buffer is null-terminated and does not exceed its allocated size, which prevents buffer overflow by capping the received bytes to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1`.
method: UNKNOWN
