    vuln-fix: CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) in falcon180b-4457 line 23 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability lies in a race condition caused by the assumption that `num_clients` has not changed between its usage and execution of the subsequent code, potentially leading to out-of-bounds array access or inconsistencies in the clients array.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, particularly around `clients[num_clients--] = -1;` at line 23 and `clients[num_clients++] = client_sock;` at line 49 in the file `falcon180b-4457`.
    why: If not resolved, the race condition could lead to crashes, unauthorized access, or other undefined behaviors, as multiple threads modify `num_clients` and the `clients` array simultaneously without synchronization.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting or disconnecting multiple clients rapidly, causing inconsistencies due to the non-atomic read-modify-write operations on `num_clients`.
    code-sources: The `recv` function at line 15, which receives user input from a socket.
    code-sinks: The `send` function at line 20, which sends the received data to other clients.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix adds a `pthread_mutex_t` to synchronize access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By locking the mutex whenever modifying these shared resources, it prevents race conditions and ensures atomic modifications, thereby eliminating the TOCTOU vulnerability.
