    
vuln-fix: Data Race (CWE-362) in gemini_pro-23401 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code contains a data race due to improper handling of shared variables when creating threads.
where: The vulnerability is located in the thread creation loop in the `main` function, specifically in the line: `pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, change_light_state, &i);`
why: If the data race is not resolved, it can lead to inconsistent and unpredictable behavior of the traffic lights, potentially causing synchronization problems and unsafe traffic light changes.
how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by creating a scenario where incorrect traffic light states could lead to unsequenced traffic lights, causing potential hazards in traffic management.
code-sources: The entry point is through the argument passed to `pthread_create`, specifically `&i` in the `main` function.
code-sinks: The action performed using the user input is the dereferencing and usage of the index in the `change_light_state` function.

   }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix resolves the vulnerability by using an array `indexes` to store the indices of the traffic lights. Each thread is then passed a unique index from this array, instead of the address of the loop variable `i`. This prevents the data race by ensuring each thread works with a separate and stable index value.
