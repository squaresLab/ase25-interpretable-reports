vuln-fix: Uninitialized Variable (CWE-457) in falcon180b-3238 at line 25 (severity: High)
what: The variable `g_server_socket` is used before being initialized.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function (line 25) in the file falcon180b-3238.
why: If `g_server_socket` is not initialized properly, it can lead to undefined behavior such as crashes or the server being unable to accept client connections.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting connections to the server, which might cause the server to crash or behave unexpectedly due to the use of an uninitialized variable.
code-sources: The entry point is the `main` function where the server socket is intended to be set up and start accepting connections.
code-sinks: The `bind`, `listen`, and `accept` functions are performed using the uninitialized server socket `g_server_socket`, marking them as sinks.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves initializing the `g_server_socket` by calling the `socket` function at the start of the `main` function. This ensures that the socket is properly set up before any operations are performed on it.
