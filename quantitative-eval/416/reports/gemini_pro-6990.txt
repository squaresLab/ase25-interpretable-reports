vuln-fix: Unbounded Write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gemini_pro-6990:32 (severity: High)
what: The code allows an unbounded write operation to occur, which may overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the file `gemini_pro-6990` at line 32, inside the `handle_client` function.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it can lead to a buffer overflow condition, which can be exploited to execute arbitrary code, crash the system, or corrupt memory.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message exceeding the buffer size, causing a buffer overflow. This can lead to arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service attacks.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv` function call at line 11, which receives data from the client into the `buffer`.
code-sinks: The sink is the `sprintf` function call at line 32, which writes the client-provided `buffer` into the `response` without validation.
suggested-fix:

     int bytes_sent = send(client_socket, response, strlen(response), 0);
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff replaces the `sprintf` function with `snprintf`, which limits the number of characters written to the `response` buffer to `BUFFER_SIZE`. This prevents writing more data than the buffer can hold, mitigating the risk of a buffer overflow.
