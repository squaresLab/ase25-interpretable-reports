    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-2631 (severity: High)
    what: The code lacks proper bounds checking on user input before sending it to other clients, leading to potential buffer overflow.
    where: 
    - Line 18: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` receives data from a client.
    - Line 23: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` outputs the received data without bounds checking.
    - Line 26: `send(clients[i][0], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` sends the potentially oversized buffer to other clients.
    why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to potential system compromise, denial-of-service, or data leakage.
    how: An attacker would send specially crafted input that exceeds the buffer size, causing a buffer overflow and potentially executing malicious code or crashing the server.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The fix ensures the buffer is correctly null-terminated after receiving data by adjusting the `recv` call to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` and adding a null-termination at `buffer[bytes_received]`. Additionally, it validates the `send` calls, ensuring errors are handled if sending data fails.
