vuln-fix: cpp/return-stack-allocated-memory (CWE-825) in codellama_13b-3965:86 (severity: High)
what: The function `input_element()` returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory. This memory is deallocated at the end of the function, which leads to a dangling pointer when the caller tries to use it.
where: Line 86 in file `codellama_13b-3965.c`
why: Dereferencing a dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior, including crashes or unexpected program behavior.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing the program to reference a dangling pointer, potentially leading to execution of arbitrary code or a crash, which could be leveraged for a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
code-sources: The entry point is the return of `fgets` in `input_element()` function on line 86.
code-sinks: The action where this memory is used is in `search_element(periodic_table_data, element)` invocation.
suggested-fix:

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix changes the allocation of memory for the `element` variable in the `input_element` function from stack allocation to heap allocation using `malloc()`. This ensures that the memory remains valid after the function returns, preventing the dangling pointer issue.
