vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-48437 at handle_client (line 12-27) and main (line 48) (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow. In the `handle_client` function, data read into the `buffer` through the `recv` function call is not properly bounded checked, allowing a potential overflow and leading to memory corruption.
where: The vulnerability is in the `handle_client` function within the function call `recv` and also in the `main` function where the server handles client connections using the `pthread_create` function.
why: Without resolving this weakness, an attacker can exploit it to execute arbitrary code on the server or cause it to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS).
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending carefully crafted input that exceeds the size of the `buffer`. This input can overwrite adjacent memory structures such as return addresses, leading to arbitrary code execution or a crash.
code-sources: The entry point is the client input received by the socket in the `recv` function call in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: The sink is when the received data is directly stored in the `buffer` and then processed (via `printf` and `send` function).

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the number of bytes read into `buffer` by `recv` does not exceed the buffer size minus one, leaving space for the null terminator. Additionally, after receiving the data, the code explicitly sets the last byte to `'\0'` to ensure null-termination, preventing possible buffer overflow. Moreover, it fixes the issue in `main` by dynamically allocating memory for `client_socket` before passing it to `pthread_create`, preventing the potential race condition and ensuring the thread gets a unique client socket value.
