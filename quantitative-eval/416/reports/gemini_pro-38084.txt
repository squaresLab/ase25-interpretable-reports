    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in gemini_pro-38084 at lines 40, 49 (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability. Multiple threads access and modify shared data without proper synchronization, potentially leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.
    where: The race condition occurs when the integer `i` is shared across multiple threads in the loop at line 49.
    why: If the race condition is not resolved, it can cause threads to read incorrect or inconsistent question and answer pairs, leading to data corruption and undefined behavior.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the timing of thread execution, causing some threads to read or write to critical variables at the same time, leading to data races and unpredictable outcomes.
    code-sources: The loop variable `i` in the main function at line 49.
    code-sinks: Usage of the loop variable `i` as an argument in the pthread_create function at line 49.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change resolves the race condition by creating an array `thread_ids` to store unique identifiers for each thread. This ensures that each thread gets a unique and correct reference to the `thread_id`, eliminating the data race over the loop variable `i`.
    method: UNKNOWN
