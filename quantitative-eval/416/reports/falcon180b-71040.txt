what: The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of received data, leading to a buffer overflow when the received data exceeds the buffer size.

where: The vulnerability occurs on lines 15-25 within the handle_client function in the file falcon180b-71040.

why: If not resolved, this weakness may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial of service, or take over the affected system.

how: An attacker could send specially crafted packets with a size larger than the buffer array (1024 bytes). Since the code does not properly check the length of data received before storing it in the buffer, this can lead to a buffer overflow.

code-sources: Data is received from the network via the recv() function on line 17.

code-sinks: The received data is copied to the buffer array and later used in the send() function on line 21.

```

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that the buffer is null-terminated, preventing overflow. Additionally, it adds a condition to break the loop if bytes_received is greater than or equal to the buffer size, thus preventing potential overflow scenarios.

method: UNKNOWN
