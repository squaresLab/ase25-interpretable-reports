  
vuln-fix: CWE-119: Buffer Overflow in gemini_pro-24350 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the way responses are sent back to clients via the `send` function.
where: Located in the `client_thread` function starting at line 12 and particularly affecting the line `if (send(clientfd, buf, sizeof(buf), 0) == -1) {` at line 23.
why: This vulnerability could lead to a buffer overflow, potentially causing the program to crash or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted message that causes the server to copy more data into the buffer than it can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
code-sources: User input is received from the `recv` call on line 15 in `client_thread`.
code-sinks: User input is used in the `send` call on line 23 in `client_thread`.

             perror("send");
             exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
         }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The fix involves changing the `send` function to send only the length of the actual message using `strlen(buf)` instead of the size of the buffer. This prevents sending unnecessary data that could lead to a buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
