vuln-fix: CWE-170: Improper Null Termination in falcon180b-26671 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability stems from improper handling of null-terminated strings. Specifically, `strtok` usage on line 25 does not ensure the string is null-terminated, and subsequently, `strlen(message)` could read beyond the allocated buffer.
where: falcon180b-26671, lines 25-28
why: If the buffer does not contain a null terminator after `recv`, functions like `strtok` and `strlen` can cause undefined behavior or memory corruption, leading to potential crashes or data leaks.
how: An attacker could send a carefully crafted message without a null terminator. This could cause the server to read beyond the buffer boundaries, potentially leaking or corrupting memory.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH, 0);` on line 19
code-sinks: `strtok(buffer, " ");` on line 25, `send(client_socket, message, strlen(message), 0);` on line 27

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer received is null-terminated by reserving one byte during the `recv` call for the null terminator and explicitly setting this null terminator after `recv` completes. This prevents `strtok` and `strlen` from reading beyond the buffer boundaries, thereby mitigating the risk of memory corruption or undefined behavior.
