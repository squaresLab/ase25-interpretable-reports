vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in gemini_pro-18229 (severity: High)

what: The code suffers from a race condition vulnerability within the `elevator_thread` function. The vulnerability arises when multiple threads attempt to update the shared `elevators` array, leading to inconsistent or unexpected behavior.

where: The vulnerability is located in `gemini_pro-18229` in the `elevator_thread` function:
```c
36: void *elevator_thread(void *arg) {
37:   int elevator_id = *(int *)arg;
38:
39:   while (1) {
40:     pthread_mutex_lock(&elevator_mutex);
```

why: If this weakness is not resolved, it can result in unpredictable behavior of the elevators, potential data corruption, and incorrect handling of passenger requests. This can impact system reliability and safety, especially in a real-world elevator system.

how: An attacker or even a regular user interacting with the system could trigger the race condition by causing multiple threads to access and modify the shared `elevators` array simultaneously. This can cause elevators to miss passenger requests or behave unpredictably.

code-sources: The entry point for user input in this application is the initialization of the elevator threads in the `main` function:
```c
58:  pthread_create(&elevator_threads[i], NULL, elevator_thread, &i);
```

code-sinks: The actions performed using user input are the updates to the `elevators` array within the thread function:
```c
elevators[elevator_id].floor = destination_floor;
elevators[elevator_id].passengers = 0;
...
elevators[elevator_id].floor = i;
elevators[elevator_id].passengers = elevators[elevator_id].passengers + 1;
```

suggested-fix: 
```diff
58c58,59
<     pthread_create(&elevator_threads[i], NULL, elevator_thread, &i);
---
>     int *elevator_id = malloc(sizeof(int));
>     *elevator_id = i;
>     pthread_create(&elevator_threads[i], NULL, elevator_thread, elevator_id);
61a63
>     free(elevator_id);
```

explanation-suggested-fix: The fix involves ensuring that each thread receives a unique elevator ID. By allocating memory for the `elevator_id` and passing it to `pthread_create`, each thread can correctly identify its assigned elevator without being affected by changes to the loop variable `i`. This prevents the race condition where multiple threads could potentially get the same elevator ID due to the way `i` is handled in the thread creation loop.
