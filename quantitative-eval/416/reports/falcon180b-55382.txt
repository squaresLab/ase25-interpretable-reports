vuln-fix: CWE-119: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-55382 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to improper handling of string lengths in the `send` function.
where: Lines related to the `handle_client` function in the file falcon180b-55382.
why: If the buffer contains data of maximum length, the `strlen(buffer)` in the `send` function may result in out-of-bounds access, leading to a potential buffer overflow and causing crashes or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker can send a carefully crafted message to the server that fills the buffer completely, exploiting the improper length handling to execute arbitrary code or crash the server.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: `send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in `handle_client`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed change modifies the `send` function to use `bytes_received`, the actual number of bytes read by `recv`, ensuring no buffer overflow occurs and eliminating the risk caused by incorrect length handling.
