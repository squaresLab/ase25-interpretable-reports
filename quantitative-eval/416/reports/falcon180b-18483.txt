 
    vuln-fix: Double Free (CWE-415) in falcon180b-18483 (severity: high)
    what: The code has a double free vulnerability. It attempts to close the same client socket descriptor multiple times if the same `client_socket` is passed by reference to multiple threads.
    where: line 53 and line 81 in `falcon180b-18483`
    why: Closing the same file descriptor multiple times can cause undefined behavior, possibly leading to crashes or corruption in the memory management system.
    how: An attacker might exploit this by forcing repeated connections in a manner that ensures the same socket descriptor is reused and closed multiple times, potentially leading to a denial of service through application crashes.
    code-sources: The sources are the incoming connections accepted on line 39 and line 81.
    code-sinks: The sinks are the printing of the client messages (line 19) and the closing of the client sockets (line 23) after the handle_client function.

    explanation-suggested-fix: This fix resolves the double free vulnerability by allocating a new memory block to store the client socket descriptor when creating a new thread. This prevents multiple threads from sharing the same pointer to the client socket descriptor.
