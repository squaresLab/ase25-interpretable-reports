vuln-fix: Unresolved race condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-58623: Multiple instances (severity: High)
what: The code contains a potential race condition due to concurrent modification of the `client_sockets` array and the `num_clients` variable by multiple threads, as well as potential race conditions around the `client_socket` variable in `main` and `handle_client`.
where: 
- `void *handle_client(void *arg)` function, lines concerning `client_socket` and `num_clients`
- `void accept_connections()`, starting from the initialization of `client_socket` and operations on `client_sockets` and `num_clients`
why: If unresolved, these race conditions could lead to undefined behavior such as data corruption, security vulnerabilities, and application crashes.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by spawning multiple connections simultaneously, potentially causing unexpected behavior due to concurrent read and write operations on the shared resources.
code-sources: Entry points are the client connections being accepted in `accept_connections()`.
code-sinks: Actions include assignments to `client_sockets[num_clients]`, increments of `num_clients`, and all operations on the `client_socket` variable.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix avoids race conditions by using a mutex to guard accessing and modifying the `client_sockets` array and the `num_clients` variable. This ensures that only one thread can access these critical sections at a time, preventing concurrent modifications that can lead to race conditions.
