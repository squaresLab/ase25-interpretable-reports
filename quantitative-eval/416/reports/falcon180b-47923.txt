vuln-fix: Missing synchronization in multithreaded environment (CWE-362) in falcon180b-47923 (severity: High)
what: The code lacks proper synchronization mechanisms for accessing the `client_sockets` array and the `num_clients` counter from multiple threads, leading to potential data races and undefined behavior.
where: In the `main` function and the `handle_client` function within falcon180b-47923
why: Failure to resolve this weakness can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior due to race conditions, where multiple threads are modifying shared data without any synchronization.
how: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by connecting multiple clients simultaneously, causing erroneous behavior due to the concurrent modification of shared resources like the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients`.
code-sources: 
- int client_socket = accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &client_addr_size);
code-sinks: 
- client_sockets[num_clients] = client_socket;
- num_clients++;

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves adding a mutex lock (`clients_mutex`) to coordinate access to critical sections where `client_sockets` and `num_clients` are modified. This ensures that only one thread can perform these modifications at a time, thus preventing race conditions and ensuring thread safety.
