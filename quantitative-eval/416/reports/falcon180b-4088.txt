vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-4088 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly limit the size of the data being copied into the `response` buffer. The `strcpy` function is used without checking if the `response` buffer has enough space to hold the incoming data, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in the following lines:

```c
if (strcmp(buffer, "ON") == 0) {
    strcpy(response, "Lights turned on.");
} else if (strcmp(buffer, "OFF") == 0) {
    strcpy(response, "Lights turned off.");
} else {
    strcpy(response, "Invalid command.");
}
```

why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, crash the program, or cause other unexpected behaviors, potentially compromising the system's security.

how: An attacker could potentially send a specially crafted packet that exceeds the buffer size, resulting in a buffer overflow. By manipulating the overflow, the attacker could overwrite function pointers or other critical data structures, leading to arbitrary code execution.

code-sources: 
- `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)`: User input received from the client socket.

code-sinks: 
- `strcpy(response, buffer)`: Unsafe copying of buffer contents to the response buffer.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff replaces `strcpy` with `strncpy` to ensure that no more than `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` characters are copied into the `response` buffer, which prevents a buffer overflow. Additionally, it adds a null terminator to the `buffer` after receiving data to ensure it is properly null-terminated. By checking the return value of `recv`, the code also handles the case where no data is received or in case of an error.
