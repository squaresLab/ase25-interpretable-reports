vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-67152 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to improper handling of received messages from clients. Specifically, the length of the message is not checked when it is handled by the server, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function when handling received messages on line 19.
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, potentially gaining control over the server.
how: An attacker would proceed to exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message that exceeds the `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH` to trigger a buffer overflow. This could lead to overwriting critical data structures or executing malicious code.
code-sources: The entry point where user input enters the application is through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function on line 21.
code-sinks: The action performed by the application using user input is the message printing and sending through the `printf` function on line 28 and `send` function also on line 28.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the `recv` function does not write more bytes into the `message` buffer than its capacity. It reads only `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH - 1` bytes to leave space for a null terminator, which is explicitly set after the `recv` call to ensure the buffer is always null-terminated. This prevents buffer overflow and potential memory corruption.
