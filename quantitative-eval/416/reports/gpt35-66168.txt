vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in gpt35-66168 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow, where the received message from a client may exceed the allocated buffer size (BUFFER_SIZE) in the client_handler function.
where: Located in gpt35-66168 on lines 16 and 24. Specifically, the line `recv(client_socket, client_message, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the client_handler function.
why: An attacker could cause a buffer overflow by sending a message that exceeds the BUFFER_SIZE, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or crashing the program.
how: An attacker simply needs to send a message to the server that exceeds the BUFFER_SIZE (1024 bytes in this case). This could overrun the `client_message` buffer and overwrite adjacent memory.
code-sources: The recv function in the client_handler function.
code-sinks: The client_message buffer in the client_handler function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: By changing the recv function to receive one less than BUFFER_SIZE and adding a null terminator after the received data, we prevent the buffer overflow issue and ensure the string is properly null-terminated.
