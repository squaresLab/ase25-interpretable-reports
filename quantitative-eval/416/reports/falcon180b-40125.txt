vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-40125 at lines 27 and 30 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly limit the size of data read into the buffer, leading to a possible buffer overflow.
where: At lines 27 (`recv`) and 30 (`send`) in the `handle_client` function found in the file falcon180b-40125.
why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to corrupt memory, leading to a crash or the execution of arbitrary code, compromising system integrity.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message larger than the buffer size, leading to memory corruption and potentially gaining control of the process execution.
code-sources: The `recv` function at line 27 in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The `send` function at lines 30 and 34 in the `handle_client` function.
suggested-fix:

explanation-suggested-fix: The modification ensures that the buffer is null-terminated after `recv` to prevent buffer overflow. It avoids reading more bytes than the buffer can hold. Additionally, `send` uses `strlen(buffer) + 1` to ensure correct string length for null-termination.
