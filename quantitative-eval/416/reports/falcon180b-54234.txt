    vuln-fix: Uninitialized Variable (CWE-457) in falcon180b-54234, line 38 (severity: High)
    what: The `main_socket` variable is used in the `setsockopt` function without being initialized, which can lead to undefined behavior.
    where: 
        - Line 38: setsockopt(main_socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &opt, sizeof(opt));
        - Line 50: bind(main_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
        - Line 51: listen(main_socket, BACKLOG);
    why: Failing to initialize the `main_socket` variable could lead to improper functioning of the server, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities such as crashes or data corruption.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering socket operations on an uninitialized or improperly initialized socket, potentially leading to undefined behavior that may crash the service or expose other vulnerabilities.
    code-sources: Client inputs through the network socket are received by the `recv` function on line 19.
    code-sinks: The input data received is printed to the server console on line 22 and then forwarded to other clients using the `send` function on line 25 if conditions match.
    suggested-fix:

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The fix initializes the `main_socket` variable by calling the `socket` function. This ensures that the `main_socket` has a valid file descriptor before it is used in subsequent socket operations, thus preventing undefined behavior.
