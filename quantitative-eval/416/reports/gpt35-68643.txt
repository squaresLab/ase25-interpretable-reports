vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-68643 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability occurs due to a potential buffer overflow when receiving the client's name and storing it in the client_t structure's name field without ensuring it's properly null-terminated.
where: Lines involving the 'read' and 'strncpy' functions in the `client_thread` function in gpt35-68643:
   - `read(client_socket, name, BUFFER_SIZE);`
   - `strncpy(players[i].name, name, BUFFER_SIZE);`
why: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities can lead to memory corruption, crashing the application, or allowing remote code execution by an attacker.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message that exceeds the buffer size, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and causing unpredictable behavior.
code-sources: The user input enters the application through the `read` function in the `client_thread` function:
   - `read(client_socket, name, BUFFER_SIZE);`
code-sinks: The user input is subsequently used without adequate length validation when storing the name in the `client_t` structure:
   - `strncpy(players[i].name, name, BUFFER_SIZE);`
   - `snprintf(message, BUFFER_SIZE, "Player %s has joined the game.", name);`

 ```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes ensure the received client name is properly null-terminated and hence, prevents buffer overflow. By reserving one byte for the null-terminator in the `name` buffer, we avoid overwriting adjacent memory regions regardless of the input provided.
