    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) and possibly Denial of Service (CWE-400) in falcon180b-53588 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability lies in broadcasting the received message from one client to all other clients. There is no limit applied on the length of the message which can lead to buffer overflow. Additionally, using the same client socket index for multiple threads can cause race conditions and memory corruption.
    where: The vulnerabilities can be found in the following lines and file:
    - `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` line 19 in `falcon180b-53588`.
    - Broadcasting the message to clients occurs starting line 23.
    - `clients[num_clients] = client_socket;` and `pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *)&client_socket);` in `main()` starting line 47.
    why: If not resolved, an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to crash the server, causing Denial of Service (DoS) or to execute arbitrary code on the server, which could lead to a sensitive data breach or system compromise.
    how: An attacker could send a specially crafted message exceeding the `BUFFER_SIZE` limit to cause buffer overflow, leading to server crash or arbitrary code execution. The race conditions and improper handling of client socket descriptors could also lead to unpredicted behavior or server crashes.
    code-sources: User input enters through the network socket in the `handle_client` function via the `recv` call.
    code-sinks: Broadcast of user input to all other clients using the `send` function inside the `for` loop in `handle_client`.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fixes address the buffer overflow by adjusting the `recv` call to only read `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes. Proper error checking and handling for `recv`, `accept`, and `socket` functions have been added. Memory allocation ensures that each thread gets its own client socket descriptor to prevent race conditions. The `clients` array is initialized to `-1` to avoid invalid indexing.
