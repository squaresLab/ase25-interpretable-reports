vuln-fix: Improper Locking (CWE-667) in falcon180b-8624 (severity: High)
what: The code has an improper locking vulnerability caused by the concurrent manipulation of shared resources (`client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable) by multiple threads without any synchronization mechanism.
where: The vulnerability is located in falcon180b-8624 at the lines manipulating `client_sockets` and `num_clients` within the `while (1)` loop in the `main` function (approximately lines 40-56).
why: Not resolving this weakness could result in race conditions leading to corrupted states of the shared resources, causing unpredictable behavior such as lost or overwritten data, server crashes, or denial of service.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by initiating multiple client connections simultaneously, causing race conditions due to unsynchronized access to the shared resources.
code-sources: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the `handle_client` function, and `int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);` in the `main` function.
code-sinks: Manipulations of the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable within the `while (1)` loop in the `main` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to ensure that the `client_sockets` array and the `num_clients` variable are safely accessed and modified by threads. The `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` calls are used to protect these critical sections, preventing race conditions.
