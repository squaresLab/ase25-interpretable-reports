vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-5006 at line 16 and line 24 (severity: High)
what: The provided code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow attack due to insufficient bounds checking when receiving data into the buffer.
where: The vulnerability occurs at lines:
```c
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
```
why: Not resolving this weakness can allow an attacker to craft inputs that overflow the buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption.
how: An attacker can send a string larger than the `BUFFER_SIZE`, causing a buffer overflow. This might overwrite memory and control the behavior of the application.
code-sources: The entry point is `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
code-sinks: The actions performed using user input are `printf("Client %d sent message: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` and `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`

+    if (bytes_received <= 0 || bytes_received >= BUFFER_SIZE) {
         break;
     }
 
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code adds a check to ensure that `bytes_received` does not exceed `BUFFER_SIZE` before processing the data. This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring that only up to BUFFER_SIZE - 1 bytes are used in the buffer, maintaining null-termination.
