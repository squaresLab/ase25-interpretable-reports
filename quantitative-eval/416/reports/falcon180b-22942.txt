    vuln-fix: CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write in falcon180b-22942 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability in this code is a potential buffer overflow due to the use of the `recv` function without proper bounds checking. This can cause writing beyond the allocated buffer size, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at line `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the file `falcon180b-22942`.
    why: An out-of-bounds write can overwrite adjacent memory, which can lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or corruption of data, posing significant security risks.
    how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by sending data exceeding `BUFFER_SIZE` to the application, triggering a buffer overflow and possibly executing arbitrary code or crashing the program.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`.
    code-sinks: The action performed using the input is located in `send(client_socket, buffer, bytes_received, 0);`.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code modification introduces a check to ensure that the number of bytes received does not exceed the buffer size (`BUFFER_SIZE`). If the condition `bytes_received > BUFFER_SIZE` is met, the client socket is closed and the thread exits. This prevents any potential out-of-bounds write, thereby mitigating the buffer overflow vulnerability.
