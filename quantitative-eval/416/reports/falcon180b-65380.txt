    vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in falcon180b-65380 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write which can occur when the program writes data past the end of an array or buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory in an unintended manner.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the file falcon180b-65380 on the lines where the client socket is handled and added to the client_sockets array.
    why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is a buffer overflow, which can lead to arbitrary code execution or crashing the application.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by connecting more than `MAX_CLIENTS` clients, which can cause access to memory beyond the boundary of the `client_sockets` array, leading to undefined behavior.
    code-sources: The entry point in code where user input (client connection) enters the application is through the `accept` function call in the `main` function on the line with `int client_socket = accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &addr_size);`.
    code-sinks: One action performed by the application using user input from a source is when the client socket is added to the `client_sockets` array: `client_sockets[num_clients] = client_socket;`.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that the `client_socket` is properly closed and checking that the `num_clients` value remains within bounds before adding the new client socket to the `client_sockets` array.
    method: UNKNOWN
