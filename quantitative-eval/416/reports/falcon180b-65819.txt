    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-662) in falcon180b-65819 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code exhibits improper synchronization when accessing the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable in a multi-threaded environment without proper locking mechanisms. This can lead to race conditions.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `main` function where the server accepts new clients and updates the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. This involves lines 52-66 in the file falcon180b-65819.
    why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is data corruption or unexpected behavior due to concurrent access to shared resources, potentially resulting in server crashes or incorrect processing of client connections.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting multiple clients to the server, causing concurrent modifications to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. This could lead to inconsistent state or memory corruption.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is the client connection accepted by `accept()` in the `main()` function.
    code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input include updating the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable, and creating threads to handle clients.
    suggested-fix: 
    ```diff
    #include <pthread.h>

    + pthread_mutex_t clients_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

    ...
    
    while (1) {
        int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);

        + pthread_mutex_lock(&clients_mutex);
        if (num_clients >= MAX_CLIENTS) {
            send(client_socket, "Server is full.\n", strlen("Server is full.\n"), 0);
            close(client_socket);
            + pthread_mutex_unlock(&clients_mutex);
            continue;
        }

        clients[num_clients][0] = client_socket;
        clients[num_clients][1] = 0;
        num_clients++;
        + pthread_mutex_unlock(&clients_mutex);

        pthread_t thread_id;
        pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);
    }
    ```

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a mutex `clients_mutex` to synchronize access to the `clients` array and the `num_clients` variable. This prevents simultaneous modifications by multiple threads, thereby avoiding race conditions.
