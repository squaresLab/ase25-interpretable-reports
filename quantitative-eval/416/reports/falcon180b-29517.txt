vuln-fix: CWE-676 (Use of Potentially Dangerous Function) in falcon180b-29517 (severity: High)
what: The code incorrectly uses `fgets(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, stdin)` to handle input from command-line which poses the risk of injection attacks. Additionally, mismanagement of threads can cause race conditions.
where: The vulnerability exists in the `handle_client` function, lines 15-20.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could inject harmful commands via standard input, which could lead to arbitrary command execution or denial-of-service. Furthermore, improper thread handling can lead to unpredictable application behavior.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted input through stdin to cause buffer overflows or execute arbitrary commands on the server. The race condition might be exploited by sending rapid connections to potentially cause thread mishandling.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the command line processed by `fgets(buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, stdin)`.
code-sinks: The action performed on input data is sending the buffer contents to the client socket using `send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0)`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix replaces `fgets` with `recv` to directly handle input from the client socket rather than stdin, reducing the injection attack risk. It also adjusts thread creation to avoid race conditions by correctly referencing the client socket.
