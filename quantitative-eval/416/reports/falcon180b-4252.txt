 
    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) and Use of Uninitialized Variable (CWE-457) in falcon180b-4252 (severity: High)
    what: The code suffers from a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the usage of `strlen` on potentially uninitialized or insufficiently checked data, which can lead to sending excessive data. Additionally, the `server_socket` variable in `main` is used without initialization.
    where: 
        - Buffer Overflow: `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in `handle_client` function.
        - Use of Uninitialized Variable: `int server_socket;` in global scope.
    why: An attacker could exploit the vulnerabilities to cause the server to crash, execute arbitrary code, or take control over the server.
    how: 
        - Buffer Overflow: An attacker could craft a malicious packet with carefully constructed data to cause `send` to transmit excessive data based on `strlen`, potentially overflowing the receiving buffer.
        - Use of Uninitialized Variable: The uninitialized `server_socket` can cause unexpected behavior when functions working with this socket are called.
    code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, MAX_DATA_SIZE, 0);` in `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in `handle_client` function.

     }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The fix includes initializing the `server_socket` to prevent undefined behavior due to accessing an uninitialized variable. It also bounds the output of the `printf` format string to avoid overflow and changes `send` to use `bytes_received` instead of `strlen(buffer)` to ensure the actual received length is used, thus preventing buffer overflow.
