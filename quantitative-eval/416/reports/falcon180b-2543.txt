    vuln-fix: Command Injection (CWE-77) in falcon180b-2543 (severity: high)
    what: The code directly uses user input in a call to the `system` function without proper validation or sanitization, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
    where: Lines involving the `system` function calls within the `handle_client` function in falcon180b-2543.
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially taking over the system or causing significant disruption.
    how: An attacker would send carefully crafted input containing shell metacharacters or command sequences to the server. Since the input is passed directly to the `system` function, it would be executed by the shell.
    code-sources: The input is received via the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
    code-sinks: The vulnerable lines are the calls to `system` in the `handle_client` function.

    < }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff changes the `strncmp` function to `strcmp`, ensuring that an exact match is required for the command to be executed. This prevents partial matches and unintended command executions that could potentially be exploited.
