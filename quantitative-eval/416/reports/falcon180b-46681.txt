    vuln-fix: Integer Overflow or Wraparound (CWE-190) in falcon180b-46681 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerable code contains an unsigned integer overflow in the handling of client connections. Specifically, the `num_clients` variable, which keeps track of the number of connected clients, can overflow when it exceeds the maximum value that an `int` can hold.
    where: The vulnerability lies in the main function of `falcon180b-46681`, particularly within the `while (1)` loop where `num_clients` is incremented on line 48.
    why: If an attacker manages to exploit this weakness, it could lead to a situation where `num_clients` exceeds its maximum allowable value, potentially causing a denial of service or allowing unauthorized access.
    how: An attacker could keep connecting new clients until the `num_clients` variable overflows. After the overflow, `num_clients` might reset to a very low or negative value, which could disrupt server operations and potentially allow further exploitations.
    code-sources: 
        1. User connection requests are handled in the `accept` call within the `while (1)` loop in the main function.
    code-sinks: 
        1. The `send` function inside the `for` loop in the `handle_client` function (line 19) broadcasts received messages to all clients.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a check to ensure that the number of clients does not exceed `MAX_CLIENTS`. If the maximum number of clients is already connected, the server will print an error message and close the new client's socket. This prevents an overflow of the `num_clients` variable. Additionally, I adjusted the client socket array assignment to prevent incorrect indexing.
