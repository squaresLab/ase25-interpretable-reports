vuln-fix: Improper Handling of Length Parameter Inconsistency (CWE-130) in falcon180b-22110: Lines 10-42 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability exists in the function `handle_client` where the received data is sent to other clients without proper validation of its length and content.
where: Lines 10-42 in falcon180b-22110.
why: An attacker could send a specially crafted message that could overflow the buffer in the recipient clients' buffer, leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker would connect to the server and send a message that exceeds the `BUFFER_SIZE` or malicious content that exploits the buffer overflow vulnerability when redistributed to other clients.
code-sources: `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
code-sinks: `send(clients[i], buffer, bytes_received, 0);`
suggested-fix: 
```

explanation-suggested-fix: The changes enforce a check to ensure that the total bytes received do not exceed the buffer size, helping to prevent buffer overflow attacks by logging the occurrence and breaking the loop.
