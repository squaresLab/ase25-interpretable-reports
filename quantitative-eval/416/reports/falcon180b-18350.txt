    vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-18350 (severity: High)
    what: The code has improper synchronization issues concerning the `clients` array and `num_clients` counter. In a multithreaded environment, shared variables (`clients` and `num_clients`) must be accessed in a thread-safe manner to avoid race conditions.
    where: The vulnerability is located at the lines interacting with `num_clients` and `clients` array in `handle_client` function and the `main` function of the file falcon180b-18350.
    why: If the issue is not resolved, it may lead to race conditions, causing unpredictable behavior like memory corruption, crashes, or incorrect handling of connected clients. This could also potentially be exploited to crash the server or execute arbitrary code.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by opening and closing connections rapidly, potentially causing race conditions or crashes due to improper access of shared variables.
    code-sources: The code source is from the `accept` function call in the `main` function where new client connections are accepted, specifically `client_socket`.
    code-sinks: The code sinks are the code segments where `clients` and `num_clients` variables are modified, which include additions to the `clients` array and increments to `num_clients`.

```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex (`client_mutex`) to ensure thread-safe operations on the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. This includes locking the mutex before modifying these shared variables and unlocking after the modifications. This prevents race conditions and ensures safe concurrent access.
