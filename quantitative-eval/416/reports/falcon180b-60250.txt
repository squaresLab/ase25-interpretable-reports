    vuln-fix: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) in falcon180b-60250 at either line 21 or 26 (severity: High)
    what: The code does not properly validate or sanitize the input received over the network before using it in a function call that relies on this input, leading to potential exploitation.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the ```handle_client``` function, specifically where the request is received and used as an argument in the ```gethostbyname``` function:
    - Line 21: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0);`
    - Line 26: `struct hostent *host_info = gethostbyname(request);`
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit it by sending specially crafted input that could lead to DNS poisoning, buffer overflows, denial of service, or remote code execution.
    how: An attacker would proceed to exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious data as part of the request expected by the application. This could include overly long strings or malicious payloads designed to exploit weaknesses in the underlying function.
    code-sources: `recv(client_socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0);` (Line 21)
    code-sinks: `gethostbyname(request);` (Line 26)

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff improves the security of the input handling process by ensuring that the received data is null-terminated, which mitigates buffer overflow risks. Furthermore, it adds validation to ensure that the request does not contain characters that are not permissible in hostnames (such as newline, carriage return, or spaces). This reduces the risk of injecting malicious data into the network request.
