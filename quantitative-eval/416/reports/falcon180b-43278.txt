 
vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-43278 at line 29 (severity: high)
what: The vulnerability is caused by a usage of `sprintf` where user input size is not properly checked, which can lead to buffer overflow.
where: The code is located in the function `monitor_thread` at line 29 in the file `falcon180b-43278`.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker can exploit it to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially taking full control of the system.
how: An attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the server that exceeds the buffer size, causing a buffer overflow when `sprintf` is called to format the response.
code-sources: `recv(connections[i].socket, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0)` in `monitor_thread`.
code-sinks: `sprintf(response, "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Length: %d\r\n\r\n", bytes_received)` in `monitor_thread`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: Changing `sprintf` to `snprintf` and specifying the buffer size ensures that the formatted string will not exceed the allocated buffer, preventing a potential buffer overflow.
