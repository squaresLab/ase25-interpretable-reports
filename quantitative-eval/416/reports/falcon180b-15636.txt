vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-15636 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability where multiple threads can access and modify the shared variable `num_clients` without proper synchronization, leading to potential incorrect behavior or crashes.
where: The race condition is located in two places: line 42 within the `handle_client` function and the global variable `num_clients` at line 8 in the file "falcon180b-15636".
why: If this weakness is not resolved, the server may miscount the number of clients connected. This can lead to resource exhaustion, denial of service, or even undefined behavior, compromising the server's availability and stability.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting multiple clients simultaneously, leading to race conditions where `num_clients` is incremented and used unsafely. This could cause the server to reject connections erroneously or crash.
code-sources: The entry points for user input are the client connections accepted via the `accept()` system call at line 58.
code-sinks: The actions performed using user inputs involve the handling of these connections and the interaction with `num_clients` at lines 42 and 58.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by introducing a mutex `clients_mutex` to protect access to the shared variable `num_clients`. The use of `pthread_mutex_lock` and `pthread_mutex_unlock` ensures that increments to `num_clients` are atomic, thus preventing race conditions and ensuring correct client tracking.
