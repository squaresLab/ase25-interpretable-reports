vuln-fix: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation in gpt35-59112 (line 69) (severity: High)
what: This vulnerability is due to a race condition where the `client_socket_fd` passed to the new thread might be modified by the main thread before the new thread can use it.
where: The vulnerability is located in the file `gpt35-59112`, specifically in the code around line 69 inside the `while` loop where threads are created.
why: If not resolved, this weakness could lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing the server to handle invalid file descriptors, which ultimately could result in denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly connecting and disconnecting multiple clients, potentially causing the server to mishandle file descriptors, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
code-sources: The main entry points for user input are through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` method.
code-sinks: The actions taken with user input are through the `send` function in the `handle_client` method.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix resolves the vulnerability by allocating memory for a new integer to store the client socket file descriptor and passing a pointer to this memory to the thread function. This ensures that even if the main thread modifies `client_socket_fd` for the next client, the thread will still have a valid and unique pointer to the correct socket descriptor.
method: UNKNOWN
