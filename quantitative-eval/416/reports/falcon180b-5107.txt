vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-5107 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly handle cases where the client might send more data than the allocated buffer size of `MAX_COMMAND_SIZE` (1024 bytes). This could lead to a buffer overflow, where memory adjacent to the buffer could be overwritten.
where: 
- handle_client function:
  - Line 16: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, MAX_COMMAND_SIZE, 0);`
why: If not resolved, this buffer overflow can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, disrupt service, or crash the program, exposing the system to potential exploits and compromises.
how: An attacker could send a specifically crafted message that exceeds the size of the `buffer` array, causing the program to write past the end of the buffer, leading to unpredictable behavior or code execution.
code-sources: 
- Line 16: `recv(client_socket, buffer, MAX_COMMAND_SIZE, 0)`
code-sinks: 
- Line 20: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);`

explanation-suggested-fix: Reducing the size parameter in the `recv` call by 1 prevents receiving more data than can be stored in the buffer, while ensuring there is space for a null terminator. Adding a null terminator after receiving the data ensures the buffer is always a valid C-string, preventing potential buffer overflows during operations like printing.
