    vuln-fix: CWE-805: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-4163 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow issue where the `recv` function can read more bytes than the size of the buffer `BUFFER_SIZE`, potentially causing a buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability occurs at the line `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket_copy, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the function `handle_client` in the file falcon180b-4163.
    why: A buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to take control of the server or crash the application, leading to denial of service.
    how: An attacker can send a specially crafted message larger than `BUFFER_SIZE` to trigger the buffer overflow, which can then overwrite adjacent memory, control program flow, or cause application termination.
    code-sources: The entry point is the client's connection and the data received from the client via the `recv` function in `handle_client`.
    code-sinks: The action performed is reading data into `buffer` from the client socket.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a new buffer `message` to hold the incoming data and checks if the received data size exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE`. If it does, it logs an appropriate message and skips processing that data. This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring that only data that fits within the `buffer` is subsequently processed.
