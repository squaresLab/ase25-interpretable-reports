vuln-fix: Race Condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-8050 at lines 24-39 (severity: High)
what: The code is vulnerable to a race condition due to manipulating shared client socket array `client_sockets` and `num_clients` without proper synchronization in multi-threaded context.
where: The vulnerability is located in lines 24-39 of the file falcon180b-8050, specifically within the `accept_connections` function and when new client threads are created with `pthread_create`.
why: Failure to resolve this vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or security vulnerabilities due to concurrent modifications of shared data structures without appropriate locks.
how: An attacker could exploit this race condition by connecting multiple clients simultaneously, causing inconsistent state or corruption of the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the `accept` function at line 6 in the `accept_connections` function.
code-sinks: The `send` function at line 31 in the `handle_client` function processes the user input from the source.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a mutex `client_mutex` to ensure that the `client_sockets` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed and modified synchronously. This prevents concurrent threads from causing a race condition by locking around critical sections of code that manipulate shared resources.
