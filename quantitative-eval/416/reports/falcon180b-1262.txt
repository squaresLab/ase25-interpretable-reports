vuln-fix: Concurrent Access to Shared Resource (CWE-362) in falcon180b-1262 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code allows multiple threads to access and modify the `num_clients` and `client_sockets` variables concurrently without synchronization, leading to potential race conditions.
where: Lines 9 (`int client_sockets[MAX_CLIENTS];`), 10 (`int num_clients = 0;`), 27 (`num_clients--`), and 70 (`num_clients++;`).
why: Not resolving this weakness can lead to inconsistent application states, crashes, or security flaws such as unauthorized access or denial of service.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing multiple simultaneous connections or disconnecting maliciously, causing unpredictable behavior in the server due to race conditions in the shared variables.
code-sources: User connections initiated in `accept_connections()` via `accept()` function.
code-sinks: Modifications to `num_clients` and `client_sockets` in `handle_client()` and `accept_connections()`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested changes introduce a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to synchronize access to the shared `num_clients` and `client_sockets` variables. This prevents race conditions by ensuring that only one thread can modify these variables at a time.
