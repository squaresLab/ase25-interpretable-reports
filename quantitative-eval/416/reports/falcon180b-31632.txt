vuln-fix: CWE-617: Reachable Assertion in falcon180b-31632 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is due to reachable assertions which can terminate the program if the assertions are triggered.
where: handle_client function in falcon180b-31632
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that the server could be terminated prematurely by triggering the assertions, leading to denial of service.
how: An attacker can send input that violates the conditions assumed by the assertions, causing them to fail and the program to terminate.
code-sources: recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0) in handle_client function
code-sinks: send(client_socket, message, strlen(message), 0) in handle_client function

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a check to ensure that the message length does not exceed the buffer size, which will prevent buffer overflows and assertion failures.
