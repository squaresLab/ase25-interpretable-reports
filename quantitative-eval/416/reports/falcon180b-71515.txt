    vuln-fix: CWE-120: Buffer Overflow in falcon180b-71515 at handle_client() (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a potential buffer overflow when the `recv` function reads data into the `buffer` without proper length checks.
    where: falcon180b-71515, line numbers around: 18-26
    why: A buffer overflow can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption.
    how: An attacker could send specially crafted data that exceeds the BUFFER_SIZE limit, causing the application to overwrite adjacent memory.
    code-sources: Entry point is the `recv` function, which reads user input from the network into the `buffer`.
    code-sinks: The input read by `recv` is directly used when calling `send` to broadcast the message to other clients.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix adds a check to ensure the number of bytes received does not exceed the buffer limit (BUFFER_SIZE - 1). This prevents a buffer overflow by ensuring that the received data fits within the bounds of the buffer.
    method: UNKNOWN
