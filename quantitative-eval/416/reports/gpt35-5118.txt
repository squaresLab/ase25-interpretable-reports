    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition') in gpt35-5118 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability here is a race condition due to improper synchronization when accessing and modifying the `client_socket` array and the `num_clients` variable. Multiple threads can concurrently access and modify these shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to unexpected behavior or a crash.
    where: The race condition occurs in the following parts of the code:
    
    1. `pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);` before adding a new client to the `client_socket` array (lines 95-97).
    2. `for(int i=0; i<num_clients; i++) {` loop in `handle_connection` method (lines 37-45).
    
    why: If this weakness is not resolved, it can result in concurrent modification issues which could lead to incorrect broadcasting of messages, corruption of the `client_socket` array, memory errors, or even a crash of the chat server.
    how: An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by rapidly sending and disconnecting multiple client connections, thereby causing threads to access the shared resources concurrently and leading to race conditions.
    code-sources: The entry point in the code where user input enters the application is the `read` function inside the `handle_connection` function.
    code-sinks: The action performed by the application using user input from a source is the `write` function inside the `handle_connection` function.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that all accesses and modifications to the shared resources, `client_socket` array and `num_clients` variable, are properly synchronized with the mutex lock/unlock mechanism. This ensures that only one thread can modify these resources at a time, preventing race conditions.
    method: UNKNOWN
