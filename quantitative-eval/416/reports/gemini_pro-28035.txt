    vuln-fix: Race condition (CWE-362) in gemini_pro-28035 (severity: High)
    what: The code creates multiple threads to simulate traffic lights; however, it passes the address of the loop variable `i` to each thread. This approach introduces a race condition because all threads will reference the same variable, causing undefined behavior as the loop variable `i` changes.
    where: Line numbers in file gemini_pro-28035:
    ```c
    pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, traffic_light, (void *)&i);
    ```
    why: If not resolved, this race condition can cause the threads to receive incorrect indices for their respective traffic lights, leading to incorrect state transitions and ultimately unsafe traffic light operations.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating thread timing, potentially causing incorrect light states and leading to traffic accidents.
    code-sources: The entry point for user input is not directly applicable here.
    code-sinks: The vulnerable action is the creation of threads using the address of a loop variable passed to pthread_create.

         for (int i = 0; i < NUM_LIGHTS; i++) {
             pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
         }
     }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: By using an array `thread_args` to store the traffic light indices and passing the array elements to `pthread_create` instead of the address of the loop variable `i`, each thread receives its unique traffic light index, eliminating the race condition.
