 
    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-46669 at handle_client function (severity: High)
    what: The buffer 'buffer' in the function 'handle_client' is susceptible to buffer overflow because the recv() function does not check the size of the data being copied into the buffer.
    where: line 15-27 in the function handle_client of falcon180b-46669
    why: If not resolved, a buffer overflow might allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, overwrite important data, or cause a denial of service.
    how: An attacker can exploit the buffer overflow by sending data larger than the BUFFER_SIZE to the application, leading to potential overwriting of adjacent memory spaces.
    code-sources: Entry point for user input is in the `recv` function on line 18.
    code-sinks: Actions performed using user input include sending data to all clients using the `send` function on line 23.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix modifies the `recv` function to ensure no more than `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes are received, leaving space for a null terminator. This ensures the `buffer` is always null-terminated, preventing buffer overflow.
