vuln-fix: Improper Null Termination (CWE-170) in falcon180b-38783, line 14 (severity: Medium)
what: The code reads data into a buffer with `recv` but does not ensure proper null termination, which can lead to buffer over-reads and undefined behavior.
where: Line 14, in `handle_client` function within falcon180b-38783.
why: Not fixing this issue can lead to buffer over-reads, data leakage, or application crashes due to undefined behavior when handling strings.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted message that does not contain a null-terminating character, causing the program to read beyond the buffer's end.
code-sources: The `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The `printf` and `send` function calls where the buffer is used.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer is properly null-terminated by adding a null character at the position indicated by `bytes_received`. This prevents buffer over-reads and ensures safe string operations.
