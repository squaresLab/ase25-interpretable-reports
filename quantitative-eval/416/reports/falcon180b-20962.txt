vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-20962 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function. When receiving data from the socket, no validation is performed on the size of the data, which can lead to writing beyond the boundaries of the `buffer`.
where: The buffer overflow occurs in the `handle_client` function when copying data into `buffer` using `recv` at line 67.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could overflow the buffer and overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or crashing the program.
how: An attacker would proceed by sending an oversized message to the server, exploiting the lack of bounds checking on the data received. This would allow them to overwrite critical memory structures or inject malicious code.
code-sources: The user input enters the application through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The user input from `recv` is then used without adequate boundary checking, leading to a potential buffer overflow when processing or sending responses with `send`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the number of bytes received does not exceed the `MAX_MESSAGE_LENGTH` for the `buffer`. This prevents writing beyond the buffer's boundaries, thus eliminating the risk of a buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
