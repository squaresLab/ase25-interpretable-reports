vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-64189 (severity: High)
what: In the provided code, there is a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. This occurs because the program reads data from a socket into a fixed-size buffer without checking if the data exceeds the buffer's capacity.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in the `recv` function call at line 15.
why: If the buffer overflow issue is not resolved, an attacker could exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service by crashing the program.
how: An attacker can send data that exceeds `BUFFER_SIZE` to the server. This data is then written to the `buffer`, which may overflow and overwrite adjacent memory locations, leading to undefined behavior or a security breach.
code-sources: `recv` function call at line 15 in the `handle_client` function where user data is read from the socket.
code-sinks: The unchecked usage of the `buffer` in the `recv` function which can lead to overflow issues.

``` 
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff fixes the buffer overflow vulnerability by ensuring that the `recv` function reads at most `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes, and by setting the last byte in the buffer to a null terminator (ensuring a valid C-string). The usage of `memset` clears the buffer more securely than `bzero`, which is deprecated.
