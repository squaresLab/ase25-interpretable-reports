vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-32041, function handle_client (severity: High)
what: The code fails to properly check the bounds when receiving data into the buffer, potentially allowing a buffer overflow.
where: Lines 13-25 in function 'handle_client' in falcon180b-32041.
why: A buffer overflow can result in arbitrary code execution, leading to a complete system compromise.
how: An attacker can send a specially crafted payload larger than the buffer size, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially overwrite adjacent memory.
code-sources: recv function in handle_client on line 16, accepting input from the client socket.
code-sinks: buffer usage in handle_client on line 16.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The fix changes the `recv` call to ensure that it receives at most `sizeof(buffer) - 1` bytes, leaving space for the null-terminator. It then explicitly null-terminates the buffer after receiving the data. This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring the buffer is always properly null-terminated.
