    vuln-fix: Null Pointer Dereference (CWE-476) in falcon180b-62579 (severity: High)
    what: The `server_socket` variable is being used without being initialized, leading to a null pointer dereference when invoking `setsockopt` and other socket operations.
    where: The vulnerability is located in lines related to the usage of `server_socket` in the main function, specifically `setsockopt(server_socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &opt, sizeof(opt));`, `bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));`, and `listen(server_socket, MAX_CLIENTS);`.
    why: Not resolving this weakness would cause the application to crash at runtime due to a null pointer dereference. This can be exploited to create a denial-of-service condition, rendering the server unavailable.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a connection request to the server, which then triggers the server's attempt to handle the socket operations with an uninitialized `server_socket`, leading to a crash.
    code-sources: The main function initializes the `server_socket` variable, but it is never actually assigned a valid socket file descriptor before being used.
    code-sinks: The `setsockopt`, `bind`, and `listen` functions use the uninitialized `server_socket` variable, causing a null pointer dereference.
    suggested-fix: 
```diff
    int main() {
+       server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
+       if (server_socket == -1) {
+           perror("Failed to create socket");
+           exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
+       }

        int opt = 1;
        setsockopt(server_socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &opt, sizeof(opt));

        struct sockaddr_in server_addr;
        memset(&server_addr, 0, sizeof(server_addr));
        server_addr.sin_family = AF_INET;
        server_addr.sin_addr.s_addr = htonl(INADDR_ANY);
        server_addr.sin_port = htons(8080);

        bind(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &server_addr, sizeof(server_addr));
        listen(server_socket, MAX_CLIENTS);

        printf("Server started on port 8080\n");
        accept_connections();

        return 0;
    }
```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff initializes the `server_socket` by creating a new socket using the `socket` function. This ensures that `server_socket` holds a valid file descriptor before itâ€™s used in operations such as `setsockopt`, `bind`, and `listen`. This prevents null pointer dereference errors.
