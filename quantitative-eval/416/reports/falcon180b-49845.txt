vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-49845 at lines 14-24, 46-59 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code does not properly validate or limit the size of input received from the client, potentially allowing a buffer overflow.
where: 
- Line 14: `void *handle_client(void *arg) {`
- Line 15: `int client_socket = *(int *) arg;`
- Line 16: `char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];`
- Line 18: `while (1) {`
- Line 19: `memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);`
- Line 20: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
- Line 21: `if (bytes_received <= 0) {`
- Line 22: `break;`
- Line 23: `}`
- Line 24: `printf("Client %d: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);`
why: Failure to resolve this vulnerability could enable an attacker to crash the application, execute arbitrary code, or gain unauthorized access to system resources.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending oversized input data that exceeds the buffer size, potentially leading to memory corruption and arbitrary code execution.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the buffer is null-terminated to prevent buffer overflows. The `printf` statement is modified to use a length-limited format specifier (`%.*s`) to safely handle the received data and avoid printing beyond the buffer's capacity, thereby mitigates the risk of buffer overflow.
