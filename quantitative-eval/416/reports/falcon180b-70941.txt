vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-70941 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability occurs due to the use of `strlen(buffer)` when sending data back to the client, without validating that the received data does not exceed `MAX_DATA_SIZE`.
where: Lines 18-26 in falcon180b-70941
why: An attacker could exploit this weakness to cause a buffer overflow, leading to crashes, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker can send specially crafted packets with data exceeding `MAX_DATA_SIZE`, causing the buffer overflow when the `send` function uses `strlen(buffer)` to determine the amount of data to send back.
code-sources: The user input enters through the `recv` function on line 19.
code-sinks: The data is used in the `send` function on line 26, and printed to the console on line 23.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix adjusts the `recv` function call to receive only `MAX_DATA_SIZE - 1` bytes to leave space for the null terminator. It also ensures that the received data is null-terminated. The `send` function is updated to use the actual number of bytes received (`bytes_received`) rather than the length of the string (as determined by `strlen`), preventing potential overflows.
