vuln-fix: CWE-838: Expression Is Always True in falcon180b-15880 at lines 37-42 (severity: Medium)
what: The vulnerability occurs due to the usage of `client_socket` in the `printf` statement and the comparison inside the `for` loop in the `handle_client` function after the client disconnects. The value of `client_socket` gets reused even after the client has been disconnected, leading to potential undefined behavior or re-use of that file descriptor.
where: The vulnerability is located in the falcon180b-15880 file, specifically in the `handle_client` function at lines 37-42.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, it can result in logs incorrect information and potentially lead to undefined behavior, since the `client_socket` value might be invalid after a client disconnects. Furthermore, it can cause the server to attempt to send data to invalid sockets.
how: An attacker would have to connect to the server and then disconnect, causing the server to potentially reuse the `client_socket` value and send data to invalid sockets. This could cause the server to crash or behave unpredictably.
code-sources: The entry point where user input enters the application is the `recv` function at line 32.
code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input are the `printf` statement at line 35 and the `send` function at line 40.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change introduces a mutex lock to ensure thread-safe operations on the clients array, and it marks the client_socket as closed before the thread finishes. This prevents re-use of already closed sockets and ensures that the code does not operate on invalid socket values, thus preventing the undefined behavior.
