vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-5665 (severity: high)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function, specifically when receiving data from clients without proper boundary checks. This allows for more data to be written into the buffer than it can safely hold.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function within the file falcon180b-5665, at the lines containing the call to `recv` and the subsequent use of the `buffer`.
why: A buffer overflow can lead to severe consequences such as crashing the application, data corruption, and even arbitrary code execution by a malicious actor.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending more data than the buffer can hold, causing the application to overwrite adjacent memory. This can lead to execution of arbitrary code if the overwritten data is subsequently used in a certain manner.
code-sources: The source of user input is the `recv` function call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The sink is the subsequent processing and display of the `buffer` content, as well as its broadcast to other clients using the `send` function.

explanation-suggested-fix: By adding an extra byte to the buffer size and ensuring null termination after the data is received, the code prevents any buffer overflow scenarios. An additional check for the `recv` function's return value ensures graceful handling of errors.
