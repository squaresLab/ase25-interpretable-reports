    vuln-fix: CWE-252: Unchecked Return Value in gpt35-30670 (severity: Medium)
    what: The vulnerability lies in the unchecked return values of the `recv()` and `write()` system calls. If these functions fail, the program does not handle the errors properly.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `connection_handler` function, specifically with the calls to `recv()` and `write()` in lines dealing with client communication.
    why: Not checking the return values of critical functions like `recv()` and `write()` could lead to improper handling of errors, which may cause undefined behavior or crashes.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing these functions to fail (e.g., through network interruptions or sending malformed packets), potentially leading to a denial of service.
    code-sources: The entry point in the code where user input enters the application is through the `recv()` call inside the `connection_handler` function.
    code-sinks: The actions performed by the application, using the user input from a source, occur in the places where `buffer` is printed or sent back to the client using `write()`.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The provided code diff resolves the vulnerability by adding checks for the return values of the `recv()` and `write()` functions. If these functions fail, an error message is printed using `perror()`, and the loop is broken to prevent further undefined behavior.
    method: UNKNOWN
