vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-16316 at lines 20-22 in function broadcast (severity: High)
what: The function `broadcast` does not properly handle potential buffer overflow due to the use of `strlen` on potentially untrusted input without bounds checking the message length.
where: At lines 20-22 in the file falcon180b-16316.
why: Not resolving this weakness could allow attackers to overflow the buffer and execute arbitrary code or crash the system, leading to potential denial of service or further exploits.
how: An attacker could send a message to the server that exceeds the size of the receiving buffer, causing the `broadcast` function to write beyond the end of `message`, leading to a buffer overflow.
code-sources: The entry point is the `recv` function in the `listen_thread` function which accepts incoming messages from clients.
code-sinks: The buffer received in `listen_thread` is subsequently passed to the `broadcast` function where it is sent to other clients using the `send` function without size validation.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures the received buffer is null-terminated to prevent reading beyond its boundaries. Additionally, it adds a check to verify the length of the buffer before passing it to `broadcast`, thus preventing a buffer overflow by ensuring that only properly sized messages are processed.
