    vuln-fix: CWE-839 in falcon180b-12796 (severity: high)
    what: The code has a vulnerability where an incorrect argument is passed to `pthread_join`, leading to undefined behavior.
    where: In the `main` function, lines where `pthread_join(task_ids[i], NULL);` is called.
    why: If not fixed, this can cause the program to crash or hang because `pthread_join` requires a `pthread_t` identifier, but an `int` is being used instead.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by running a malformed program designed to cause denial of service on the system.
    code-sources: The initialization of task IDs as integers in `main`.
    code-sinks: The usage of task IDs in `pthread_join` in `main` and `pthread_create` in `schedule_task`.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The fix changes the `task_ids` array to `threads`, which holds `pthread_t` identifiers for each thread. This ensures that the correct data type is passed to both `pthread_create` and `pthread_join`, resolving the type mismatch and preventing undefined behavior.
