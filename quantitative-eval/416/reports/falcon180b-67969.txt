vuln-fix: Race condition (CWE-362) in falcon180b-67969 (severity: High)
what: The code has a race condition due to the fact that the variable 'i' is shared between the main thread and the new threads being created.
where: Lines 22-24 in falcon180b-67969
why: If this race condition is not resolved, it may lead to undefined behavior, where threads may receive incorrect thread IDs or fail to start correctly.
how: An attacker could potentially exploit this race condition to cause the application to misbehave in unpredictable ways, possibly causing a denial of service or incorrect processing.
code-sources: `void* thread_func(void* arg)` function where thread IDs are passed as arguments.
code-sinks: Creation of threads in the `main` function and accessing the shared 'i' variable.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

// Mutex for thread synchronization
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

// Condition variable for thread synchronization
pthread_cond_t condition = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

// Number of threads
#define NUM_THREADS 5

// Function to be executed by each thread
void* thread_func(void* arg) {
    int id = *(int*) arg;
    printf("Thread %d started\n", id);

    // Lock the mutex
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

    // Signal the main thread that a new thread has started
    pthread_cond_signal(&condition);

    // Wait for the main thread to signal that it's time to exit
    pthread_cond_wait(&condition, &mutex);

    // Unlock the mutex
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    printf("Thread %d exited\n", id);
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
    int thread_ids[NUM_THREADS]; // Separate array to store thread IDs

    // Create threads
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        thread_ids[i] = i; // Assign unique thread IDs
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_func, (void*) &thread_ids[i]); 
    }

    // Wait for threads to finish
    for (int i = 0; i < NUM_THREADS; i++) {
        pthread_join(threads[i], NULL);
    }

    printf("Main thread exited\n");
    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change ensures that each thread gets a unique ID by creating a separate array `thread_ids` to hold unique thread IDs. This prevents the race condition in the original code where the shared variable 'i' could be modified by the main thread while being read by a new thread.
