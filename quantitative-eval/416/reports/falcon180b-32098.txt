 
vuln-fix: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122) in falcon180b-32098 (severity: High)
what: The buffer `buffer` within the `handle_client` function may be subject to a heap-based buffer overflow. The `recv` function receives data from the client socket and directly stores it into the `buffer` array without proper bounds checking.
where: Lines 15-20 in the file falcon180b-32098.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker can exploit it to perform arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or gain unauthorized access to the system.
how: An attacker would proceed by sending more data than the `buffer` can handle, potentially overwriting memory areas adjacent to the buffer. This can corrupt the program's heap, leading to unpredictable behavior or system compromise. 
code-sources: The `recv` function call receives data from the client socket, where the user input originates.
code-sinks: The buffer `buffer` in the `handle_client` function is the sink where the user input is stored.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code fix changes the `recv` function to ensure that at most `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes are received, leaving space for a null terminator. This eliminates the potential for buffer overflow by ensuring that any received data fits within the `buffer`. Moreover, an additional check is added to break out of the loop in case `recv` returns a negative value, which indicates a reception error.
