vuln-fix: Improper Null Termination (CWE-170) in falcon180b-45817:30 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of received data where the buffer is not explicitly null-terminated after receiving data from the client. This can lead to potential buffer overflows and undefined behavior.
where: The vulnerability is located on line 30 in the `falcon180b-45817` file.
why: Not resolving this weakness may lead to potential buffer overflow issues, causing crashes, data corruption, or providing an attack vector for malicious entities to execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker could send a specifically crafted series of bytes without a null terminator, which could cause the program to read beyond the bufferâ€™s allocated memory, leading to potential exploitation options like denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
code-sources: 
    - `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0)` in `handle_client` function (line 30)
code-sinks: 
    - `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer)` in `handle_client` function (line 34)
    - `send(clients[i][0], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0)` in `handle_client` function (line 38)

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds a line to explicitly null-terminate the buffer after receiving data from the client. This mitigates the risk of buffer overflows and ensures that any function operating on the buffer will behave correctly and safely.
