    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-68315 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow caused by the use of `strlen(buffer)` instead of `bytes_received` when sending data to other clients.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function.
    why: Not resolving this buffer overflow could lead to data corruption, crashes, or potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted message that exceeds the expected buffer length, causing the program to read beyond the bounds of the buffer and potentially overwrite adjacent memory.
    code-sources: Data received through the socket in the `recv` call.
    code-sinks: Data sent through the socket in the `send` call.
    suggested-fix:

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix replaces `strlen(buffer)` with `bytes_received`. This ensures that the number of bytes sent is exactly the number of bytes received, preventing buffer overflow by avoiding unintended access beyond the buffer's boundaries.
    method: UNKNOWN
