vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-46466 (severity: High)
what: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function due to the improper use of `sprintf` which could write more data into the `response` buffer than it can hold, leading to a buffer overflow.
where: 
- File: falcon180b-46466
- Vulnerable line: 
```c
sprintf(response, "Response to client %d", client_sock);
```
why: Not resolving this weakness can allow an attacker to overflow the buffer `response` causing data corruption, crashes, or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted request to create a response string longer than `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`, leading to the overflow and potential exploitation.
code-sources: 
- `recv(client_sock, request, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, 0)` in `handle_client` function 
code-sinks: 
- `sprintf(response, "Response to client %d", client_sock)` in `handle_client` function
suggested-fix: 
```diff
24c24
< sprintf(response, "Response to client %d", client_sock);
---
> snprintf(response, MAX_REQUEST_SIZE, "Response to client %d", client_sock);
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff replaces `sprintf` with `snprintf` which includes a buffer size parameter, ensuring that the data written to the `response` buffer does not exceed its allocated size, thus preventing buffer overflow.
