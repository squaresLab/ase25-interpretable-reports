vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-22640 (severity: High)
what: The code is vulnerable to a buffer overflow exploit due to improper handling of the buffer variable within the handle_client function. When data is received from the client, it is stored in a fixed-size buffer (BUFFER_SIZE). If the received data exceeds BUFFER_SIZE, it can lead to a buffer overflow, causing unexpected behavior including application crashes or malicious code execution.
where: The vulnerability exists in falcon180b-22640 at the following line:
```c
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
```
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker could exploit the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to a full system compromise or data leakage.
how: An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted, oversized payload to the server. The payload would overflow the buffer, overwriting adjacent memory, which could lead to execution of malicious code or crashing the server.
code-sources: The source of user input is the recv function at the following location:
```c
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
```
code-sinks: The potential sink where the buffer data is used is:
```c
printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
```
suggested-fix: 
```diff
- printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
+ printf("Client %d sent: %.*s\n", client_socket, bytes_received, buffer);
- send(client_socket, buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
+ send(client_socket, buffer, bytes_received, 0);
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that only the valid portion of the received buffer is used. The printf function is updated to use the exact number of bytes received, rather than assuming the data is null-terminated string. The send function is similarly updated to send only the received bytes, preventing the possibility of buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
