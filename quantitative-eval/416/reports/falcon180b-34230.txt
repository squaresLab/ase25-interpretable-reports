    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-34230 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow risk caused by unchecked inputs potentially exceeding buffer sizes.
    where: Lines 20-34 in `falcon180b-34230`
    why: If an attacker exploits this, they can overwrite memory, leading to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data leaks.
    how: An attacker could send a large payload to the `recv` function which would exceed `buffer` size causing an overflow.
    code-sources: `recv()` at line 23 where the input is received.
    code-sinks: `printf()` at line 28 and `send()` at lines 31-33 where the received input is used.

        }
    }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by limiting the `recv` call to only receive `BUFFER_SIZE-1` bytes and explicitly null-terminating the buffer to prevent buffer overflows.
    method: UNKNOWN
