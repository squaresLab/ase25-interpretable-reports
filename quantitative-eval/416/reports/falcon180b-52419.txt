vuln-fix: CWE-459: Incomplete Cleanup in falcon180b-52419 (severity: high)
what: The vulnerability is an Incomplete Cleanup issue where socket descriptors are not being properly closed, and threads are not adequately terminated. This can lead to resource leaks and potentially allow attackers to exhaust server resources.
where: Lines in the `handle_client` and `accept_connections` functions in falcon180b-52419; specifically, lines where `pthread_exit` and `close` are used without adequate checks or cleanup.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, the server can eventually run out of available file descriptors, causing denial of service as it won't be able to accept new connections.
how: An attacker could repeatedly connect to the server and then abruptly disconnect, leading to resource exhaustion over time since the server doesn't clean up resources appropriately.
code-sources: The primary entry point for user input is `accept` in the `accept_connections` function and `recv` in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The `send` function in the `handle_client` function uses the data received from the user.
suggested-fix:

explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed changes involve several steps to clean up resources properly. Adding `pthread_detach(pthread_self())` within `handle_client` ensures that the thread resources are freed upon termination. Checking `client_socket == -1` and closing the socket immediately in `accept_connections` prevents further resource utilization by invalid sockets. Properly initializing `server_socket` in `main` ensures itâ€™s created with necessary handling, and any error leads to proper exit with detailed logging.
