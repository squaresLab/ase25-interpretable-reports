    vuln-fix: Return of stack-allocated memory (CWE-825) in gemini_pro-4506, lines 26, 37, 51 (severity: HIGH)
    what: A function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory. This memory is deallocated at the end of the function, which may lead the caller to dereference a dangling pointer.
    where: gemini_pro-4506, lines 26, 37, 51
    why: Dereferencing a dangling pointer leads to undefined behavior, which can cause the application to crash or be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    how: An attacker would trick the application into using the invalid pointer, potentially leading to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.
    code-sources: Main function initializing and calling matrix operations.
    code-sinks: Any operations attempting to access the returned pointer from add_matrices, subtract_matrices, or multiply_matrices functions.
    suggested-fix:

    explanation-suggested-fix: The fix involves changing the matrix operation functions to take an additional parameter for the output matrix. This ensures that the resultant matrices are allocated in the caller's scope, avoiding returning pointers to stack-allocated memory which will have been deallocated.
