vuln-fix: Command Injection (CWE-77) in falcon180b-7737 (severity: Critical)
what: The program uses the `system` function to execute shell commands based on user input without proper sanitization or validation, leading to a Command Injection vulnerability.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically at these lines:
```c
if (strstr(buffer, "LIGHT ON") != NULL) {
    system("gpio -g write 4 1");
} else if (strstr(buffer, "LIGHT OFF") != NULL) {
    system("gpio -g write 4 0");
}
```
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the system, leading to unauthorized actions, data leakage, or complete system compromise.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted input that includes shell metacharacters or additional commands. For example, sending the message "LIGHT ON; rm -rf /" could execute the `rm -rf /` command, which would delete the root filesystem.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the `recv` function in the `handle_client` function:
```c
int bytes_received = recv(client_sock, buffer, 1024, 0);
```
code-sinks: The code sinks are the calls to the `system` function within the `handle_client` function:
```c
system("gpio -g write 4 1");
system("gpio -g write 4 0");
```

         }
     }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix explicitly specifies the path to the `gpio` binary and checks the return value of the `system` function. This avoids the risk of command injection via environment manipulation but still doesn't address potential injection in argument values. Further, using a more secure API to directly interact with GPIO would be preferable if available.
