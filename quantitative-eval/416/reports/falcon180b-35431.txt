vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-35431 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a race condition vulnerability due to improper synchronization while accessing and modifying shared resources (`num_clients` and `client_sockets`).
where: Lines where `num_clients` and `client_sockets` are accessed and modified (e.g., lines 18-20 and 43-48).
why: If this weakness is not resolved, multiple threads may concurrently modify shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to data corruption, unexpected behavior, or crash of the program.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by rapidly creating and closing client connections, potentially causing memory corruption, server crashes, or denial of service.
code-sources: User inputs come through network connections accepted by the server (`accept` function).
code-sinks: Actions performed include reading (`recv`) and writing (`send`) to the client sockets based on user input.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a mutex `client_mutex` to protect access to the shared resources `num_clients` and `client_sockets`. By locking the mutex before modifying these resources and unlocking it afterwards, race conditions are prevented, ensuring that only one thread can modify these variables at a time.
