vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-59563:77-78 (severity: High)
what: The code does not validate the length of the data received from the client before echoing it back. Therefore, an attacker can send a large message that exceeds 'BUFFER_SIZE', causing possible buffer overflow.
where: Lines 77-78 in file 'falcon180b-59563'
why: If not resolved, a Buffer Overflow can allow attackers to overwrite memory, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution, leading to system compromise.
how: An attacker would send data larger than 'BUFFER_SIZE' to exploit this vulnerability, causing the program to write beyond the allocated buffer and corrupt memory.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is at line 77 with the `recv` function.
code-sinks: The action is performed on line 78 with the `send` function.
suggested-fix:

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring that the received data is always null-terminated and that the `recv` function does not write more than the buffer can hold, thus preventing buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
