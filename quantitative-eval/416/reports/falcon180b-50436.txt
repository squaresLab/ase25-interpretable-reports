 
vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-50436 (severity: High)
what: The buffer used to receive data from the client is vulnerable to buffer overflow because the received data is directly written into a fixed-size buffer without proper boundary checks.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, particularly at lines:
   ```c
   int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
   ```
   in file `falcon180b-50436`.
why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause a crash, execute arbitrary code, or perform other malicious activities, potentially compromising the system's security or availability.
how: An attacker can send more data than the `BUFFER_SIZE` to the server, causing an overflow in the `buffer` array. Since the server code does not validate the size of the incoming data, the excess data can overwrite adjacent memory, leading to unpredictable behavior.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv()` function in `handle_client`:
   ```c
   int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);
   ```
code-sinks: The actions performed by the application after receiving user input include responding to the client or processing the received data, which could be influenced if the buffer overflow is exploited.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff ensures that the buffer always null-terminates after receiving input, which prevents potential overflows and ensures that the buffer is treated as a proper string.
