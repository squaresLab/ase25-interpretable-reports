 
vuln-fix: CWE-665: Improper Initialization in falcon180b-47393 (severity: High)
what: There is an improper initialization vulnerability in the client handling code. Specifically, the function `pthread_create()` is called with a pointer to `client_socket` which is a local variable that may change before the thread starts executing.
where: The vulnerability is found in the file `falcon180b-47393` on line 65 where the `pthread_create()` function is called.
why: If the vulnerability is not resolved, a scenario where `client_socket` value changes before the thread starts executing may lead to incorrect client handling or even cause the server to crash.
how: To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to connect multiple clients quickly in succession, potentially causing race conditions and undefined behavior in how client connections are handled.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is through the socket connection accepted in the main while loop, where client message handling is performed in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The user's input is used in the `send` function inside the `handle_client` function.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
 int client_socket = accept(server_socket, (struct sockaddr *) &client_addr, &client_addr_size);
if (client_socket == -1) {
    printf("Error accepting connection\n");
    continue;
}

if (num_clients >= MAX_CLIENTS) {
    send(client_socket, "Server is full\n", strlen("Server is full\n"), 0);
    close(client_socket);
    continue;
}

client_sockets[num_clients] = client_socket;
num_clients++;

pthread_t thread_id;
- pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);
+ int *new_client_socket = malloc(sizeof(int));
+ *new_client_socket = client_socket;
+ pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) new_client_socket);
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change involves dynamically allocating memory for each `client_socket` and passing the allocated memory to the `pthread_create()` function. This ensures that each thread handles the correct client socket and prevents race conditions relating to the changing value of the local variable `client_socket`.
