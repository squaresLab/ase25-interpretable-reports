vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in codellama_13b-4826 at line 38 (severity: High)
what: The code writes user input directly into a fixed-size buffer without checking for buffer overflow, which can lead to memory corruption.
where: Vulnerability is located in the main function at line:
    - Line 38: `scanf("%s", device_name);`
why: Buffer overflow can lead to unintended behavior including crashes, data corruption or execution of arbitrary code by an attacker. This compromises the overall security and stability of the application.
how: An attacker can input a name longer than 31 characters (+1 for null-terminator), causing the buffer `device_name` to overflow. This can overwrite adjacent memory and potentially inject malicious code or corrupt data.
code-sources: `scanf("%s", device_name);`
code-sinks: `devices[num_devices].name = device_name;` without enforcing boundary condition checks.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff limits the input size with `scanf("%31s", device_name)`, ensuring that no more than 31 characters are written to `device_name`, preventing buffer overflow. Additionally, it checks for `scanf` failure and exits on error to ensure program stability.
