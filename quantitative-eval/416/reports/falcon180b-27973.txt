vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-821) in falcon180b-27973 (severity: High)
what: The code contains an improper synchronization vulnerability in managing the `clients` array and the `num_clients` counter. Multiple threads may access and modify these shared variables concurrently without proper synchronization, leading to potential data races or inconsistencies.
where: The vulnerability is located in the file `falcon180b-27973` within the `main` function and the `handle_client` function.
why: If not resolved, this weakness can cause data corruption, application crashes, or unpredictable behavior due to multiple threads manipulating the shared state unsafely. This can lead to system instability and may also open up the possibility for attackers to exploit these race conditions.
how: An attacker could send multiple connection requests in quick succession, exploiting the lack of synchronization to cause inconsistent updates to the `clients` array or `num_clients` counter. This could lead to memory corruption, resource leaks, or unexpected behavior in the application.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` call in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The user input data is used in `printf("Client %d: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` in the `handle_client` function without any synchronization mechanism.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes introduce a mutex `clients_mutex` to synchronize access to the `clients` array and the `num_clients` counter. The mutex is locked before modifying these shared variables and unlocked after the modifications are done. This ensures that only one thread can access these critical sections at a time, preventing data races and ensuring thread-safe updates.
