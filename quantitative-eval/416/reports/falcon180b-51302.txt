vuln-fix: CWE-665 Improper Initialization and CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write in falcon180b-51302 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is due to improper initialization of the `server_socket` and the potential out-of-bounds write that can occur with the `clients` array.
where: 
- Improper Initialization of `server_socket` at `setsockopt` in main function
- Out-of-bounds write in `clients` array in `main` function 

why: Failure to properly initialize the `server_socket` can lead to undefined behavior, which may cause security issues such as crashes or data corruption. Additionally, not properly checking the bounds before writing to the `clients` array may lead to an out-of-bounds write, which could corrupt memory or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code.

how: An attacker could exploit the uninitialized `server_socket` to perform a denial-of-service (DoS) attack by causing the application to crash or behave unexpectedly. By exploiting the out-of-bounds write, an attacker could potentially overwrite memory, leading to arbitrary code execution or corruption.

code-sources: Entry point for user input is through the `recv` function call in `handle_client`.
code-sinks: Actions performed using user input include the call to `send`, where data from the user is sent back.

    close(server_socket);
    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix initializes the `server_socket` by calling the `socket` function and checks if it fails to create the socket. Additionally, the check for the number of clients `num_clients` is changed from `==` to `>=` before writing to the `clients` array, preventing an out-of-bounds write.
