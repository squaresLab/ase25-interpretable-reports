vuln-fix: Unbounded Buffer Write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gpt35-63037 at line 26 (severity: High)
what: This vulnerability exists because there are buffer write operations that do not control the length of the data written, which can result in a buffer overflow.
where: Line 26 of `gpt35-63037` contains the vulnerable code: `sprintf(msg, "%s: %s", cl->name, msg);`.
why: If this weakness is not resolved, an attacker can exploit this buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, crash the server, or exploit other vulnerabilities leading to potential full system compromise.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted input that exceeds the buffer limit, causing a buffer overflow.
code-sources: The `fgets(cl.name, 50, stdin);` on line 83 and `fgets(msg, MAX_MSG_LENGTH, stdin);` on line 16 are entry points where user input enters the application.
code-sinks: The line `sprintf(msg, "%s: %s", cl->name, msg);` at line 26 writes user input to a buffer without bounds checking.

         }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: By replacing `sprintf` with `snprintf`, the length of the data written to the `msg` buffer is controlled, preventing buffer overflow. The `snprintf` function limits the number of characters written to `msg` to `MAX_MSG_LENGTH`.
