 
    vuln-fix: Double-Free Vulnerability (CWE-415) in falcon180b-1645.c (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a potential double-free issue. The `client_socket` is used by reference in the `accept_connections` function, but it is passed by reference to the `handle_client` function. When `pthread_exit` is called, the thread's stack (which includes local variables such as `client_socket`) is destructed, and hence, attempting to close the same socket or access it again may lead to a double-free or undefined behavior.
    where: Located in `falcon180b-1645.c` in the `handle_client` function and `accept_connections` function.
    why: A double-free vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution, crashes, and memory corruption. An attacker can exploit this to take control of the system or make the application behave unexpectedly.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by causing a client to connect and disconnect multiple times, potentially causing repeated invocations of the same socket close, leading to double-free vulnerabilities.
    code-sources: The `accept` function in the `accept_connections` function, which processes incoming client connections and uses the socket descriptor.
    code-sinks: The `recv` and `send` functions in the `handle_client` function, which use the socket descriptor passed by reference.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix involves dynamically allocating memory for the `client_socket` variable inside the `accept_connections` function. This ensures that each client connection is handled with a unique memory reference, preventing double-free vulnerabilities when the `handle_client` function uses the socket descriptor.
