    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120/CWE-787/CWE-805) in gpt35-34852 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow, where the length of the data written into the buffer is not controlled.
    where: Line 95 in the file gpt35-34852: `strcat(message, buffer);`
    why: If not resolved, this vulnerability can allow an attacker to write beyond the memory bounds of the buffer, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or application crashes.
    how: An attacker could send a message to the server that exceeds the size of the `message` or `buffer` arrays, causing an overflow when `strcat` concatenates the `buffer` to `message`.
    code-sources: Line 85 in gpt35-34852: `recv(client_fd, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0)`
    code-sinks: Line 95 in gpt35-34852: `strcat(message, buffer)`

    explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix replaces the unsafe `strcat` usage with `snprintf`, which ensures that the overflow does not occur by controlling the amount of data written into the `message` buffer. Additionally, it ensures that the `buffer` is null-terminated before usage. This change prevents buffer overflows by safely concatenating the strings.
