vuln-fix: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in gpt35-35536 (severity: High)
what: The server code allows clients to specify arbitrary filenames, which can lead to path traversal vulnerabilities.
where: The vulnerability is located in the function `client_handler` starting at line 62, specifically around the file handling operations.
why: Failure to sanitize or properly validate file paths could allow an attacker to access and manipulate sensitive files on the server, leading to unauthorized data access or data loss.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious filenames such as "../../etc/passwd" to read or overwrite sensitive system files.
code-sources: The code source is at `recv(client_sock, filename, BUF_SIZE, 0)`, where the filename is received from the client.
code-sinks: The code sink is at `fopen(filename, "wb")`, where the received filename is used to open or create a file.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix adds checks to ensure the filename received from the client does not contain sequences that could allow path traversal (e.g., "../"). It also validates the filename to ensure it does not contain illegal characters such as '/' or '\' which could be used to navigate directories. These checks prevent an attacker from using path traversal techniques to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
