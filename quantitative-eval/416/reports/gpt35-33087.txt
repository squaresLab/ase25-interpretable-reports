vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-33087:13 (severity: High)
what: The code reads data from a socket connection into a fixed-size buffer without checking the length of the received data, which can lead to buffer overflow.
where: The vulnerability is located in the handle_client function, specifically at line 13 in the file gpt35-33087.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit it to execute arbitrary code, which could lead to a complete system compromise.
how: An attacker would send a specially crafted message that exceeds the buffer size (1024 bytes) to the server, causing a buffer overflow and potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
code-sources: The user input enters the application through the recv function call at line 13.
code-sinks: The application uses the input in a printf function call, which can lead to a buffer overflow.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix includes checking the length of the received data, ensuring null termination of the buffer, and limiting the output to the buffer size to prevent buffer overflow.
