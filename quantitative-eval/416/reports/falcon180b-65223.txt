vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-65223 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a race condition where multiple threads access and modify shared data (`clients` array and `num_clients` variable) without proper synchronization.
where: Lines 39-42 in the file `falcon180b-65223`
why: If left unresolved, the race condition can lead to inconsistent state of the server, such as overwriting client connections, invalid memory access, or crashes. This can disrupt service availability and potentially allow for further exploits.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating multiple client connections rapidly. This might put the server into a state where it mishandles client connections due to the unsynchronized access to `num_clients` and `clients` array, possibly causing the server to crash or behave unpredictably.
code-sources: The entry point for user input is the `accept` function, which accepts incoming client connections.
code-sinks: The `clients[num_clients++]` statement in line 42 and the use of `client_socket` in subsequent threads.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the race condition by adding a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to synchronize access to shared resources (`clients` array and `num_clients` variable). By locking the mutex before modifying these resources and unlocking it afterward, the code ensures that only one thread can access and modify the shared data at a time.
