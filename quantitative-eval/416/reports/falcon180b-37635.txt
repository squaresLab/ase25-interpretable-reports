vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-37635 (severity: High)
what: The code dynamically creates and manages multiple threads without proper synchronization, which can lead to a race condition.
where: `falcon180b-37635`, specifically within the `thread_func` function and the `main` function:
```c
void *thread_func(void *arg) {
    ...
    int id = *((int *) arg);
    ...
}

int main() {
    ...
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_func, (void *) &i);
    }
    ...
}
```
why: If not resolved, this weakness could lead to unpredictable behavior, such as incorrect initialization of thread IDs or premature termination of threads, potentially causing the application to crash or data corruption.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by triggering multiple threads concurrently with specially crafted inputs, leading to inconsistent behavior, data corruption, and even application crashes.
code-sources: The code source is where the thread IDs are being passed to the `pthread_create` function:
```c
pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_func, (void *) &i);
```
code-sinks: The code effective sinks are where the thread IDs are being dereferenced and used:
```c
int id = *((int *) arg);
```
suggested-fix: 
```diff
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

// Mutex for protecting shared data
pthread_mutex_t mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

// Condition variable for signaling threads
pthread_cond_t cond = PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER;

// Flag for indicating whether all threads have finished
int finished = 0;

// Function called by each thread
void *thread_func(void *arg) {
    // Extract the thread id
    int id = *((int *) arg);

    // Lock the mutex to protect shared data
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

    // Signal the main thread that a new thread has started
    pthread_cond_signal(&cond);

    // Do some work...
    printf("Thread %d started.\n", id);
    sleep(1);
    printf("Thread %d finished.\n", id);

    // Unlock the mutex
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    // Signal the main thread that a thread has finished
    pthread_cond_signal(&cond);

    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    // Create an array of thread IDs
    pthread_t threads[5];
    int thread_ids[5];

    // Create 5 threads
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        thread_ids[i] = i;
        pthread_create(&threads[i], NULL, thread_func, (void *) &thread_ids[i]);
    }

    // Lock the mutex to protect shared data
    pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

    // Wait for all threads to finish
    while (finished < 5) {
        // Signal the main thread when a thread has started
        pthread_cond_wait(&cond, &mutex);
        finished++;
    }

    // Unlock the mutex
    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The fix involves creating a separate array `thread_ids` to hold the IDs of the threads. This ensures that each thread receives a unique id value, avoiding the race condition that occurs when passing the address of the loop variable `i` directly.
