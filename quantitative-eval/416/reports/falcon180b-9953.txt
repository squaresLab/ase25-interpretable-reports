vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in falcon180b-9953 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write that occurs when the program attempts to access write locations in memory that are outside the bounds of an allocated array.
where: The vulnerability exists in the file falcon180b-9953, specifically within the handle_client function where the client_sockets array is accessed.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit it to execute arbitrary code, cause a denial-of-service condition, or corrupt memory, potentially leading to system crashes or other unpredictable behavior.
how: An attacker connected to the server could send specially crafted data to cause the buffer to overflow, leading to an out-of-bounds write. This could result in overwriting adjacent memory and potentially lead to remote code execution or crashing the server.
code-sources: 
- Accept function (`int client_socket = accept(server_socket, NULL, NULL);` in main function)
- Receive function (`int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUF_SIZE, 0);` in handle_client function)
code-sinks: 
- Send function (`send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);` in handle_client function)
suggested-fix:

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by ensuring the buffer is null-terminated, preventing potential out-of-bounds writes. Additionally, changing the comparison condition in the loop ensures it correctly checks the sockets, preventing incorrect memory accesses.
