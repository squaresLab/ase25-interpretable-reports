vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-28652 (severity: high)
what: The implementation has a buffer overflow vulnerability due to the direct use of `recv()` to store received data into a fixed-size buffer without properly checking the size of the input.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, specifically in the line `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`.
why: An attacker can exploit this by sending data larger than `BUFFER_SIZE`, which can lead to overwriting adjacent memory. This can cause crashes or even allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker would send a payload larger than 1024 bytes to the server. Since there's no bounds checking, this data would overflow the buffer, potentially overwriting memory and leading to unpredictable behavior or code execution.
code-sources: Code line: `int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);`
code-sinks: Code line: `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` and `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The fix ensures that the buffer is not overflowed by limiting the bytes received to `BUFFER_SIZE - 1`, providing space for the null terminator. This improves the security by preventing buffer overflow.
