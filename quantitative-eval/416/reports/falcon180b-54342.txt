vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-54342 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a race condition due to unsafe handling of the `num_clients` and `clients` array. Multiple threads can access and modify these shared resources concurrently, leading to unexpected behavior.
where: The race condition is in the `main` function and the `handle_client` function when accessing and modifying `num_clients` and `clients` arrays.
why: If not resolved, this race condition can cause data corruption, crashes, or lead to other undefined behaviors as multiple threads modify shared resources without proper synchronization.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting multiple clients simultaneously, inducing a race condition in the access or modification of the `num_clients` and `clients` array, which can cause inconsistent or erroneous state.
code-sources: The `accept` function call in the `main` function is one entry point for user input.
code-sinks: The `clients` array and `num_clients` variable in the `main` function and `handle_client` function are the sinks where the user input is used.

            close(client_socket);
            continue;
        }

        clients[num_clients++] = client_socket;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&clients_mutex);

        pthread_t thread_id;
        pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);
    }
```
```diff
    while (1) {
        memset(buffer, 0, BUFFER_SIZE);
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);

        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            break;
        }

        pthread_mutex_lock(&clients_mutex);
        for (int i = 0; i < num_clients; i++) {
            if (clients[i] != client_socket) {
                send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);
            }
        }
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&clients_mutex);
    }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed code changes introduce a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to protect access to the shared `num_clients` variable and the `clients` array. By locking the mutex before modifying these shared resources and unlocking it after the modifications, we ensure that only one thread can access these critical sections at a time, thus preventing race conditions.
