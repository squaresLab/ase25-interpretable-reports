    vuln-fix: Use-After-Free (CWE-416) in gemini_pro-3793:83 (severity: High)
    what: The `free_book` function frees the memory allocated for the book title, pages, and page content. However, the `print_toc` and `print_page` functions use pointers to this freed memory, leading to use-after-free vulnerabilities.
    where: 
        - `print_toc(book);` in line 83
        - `print_page(&book->pages[0]);` in line 86
    why: Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing the program to crash, behave unexpectedly, or execute arbitrary code.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by manipulating the book data in such a way as to cause the application to access this freed memory, potentially leading to data corruption or code execution.
    code-sources: 
        - `fgets(title, 256, fp);` in line 32
        - `fscanf(fp, "%d", &num_pages);` in line 36
        - `fgets(content, 1024, fp);` in line 44
    code-sinks:
        - `book->pages[i].content = strdup(content);` in line 45
        - `printf("Page %d:\n%s", page->number, page->content);` in line 65
        - `printf("  %d. %s", book->pages[i].number, book->pages[i].content);` in line 72

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that the `free_book` function is not called until the `print_toc` and `print_page` functions have finished using the `book` structure. This prevents any use-after-free vulnerabilities by ensuring no dereferencing of pointers to freed memory.
    method: UNKNOWN
