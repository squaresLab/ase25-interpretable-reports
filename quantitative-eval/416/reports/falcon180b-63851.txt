vuln-fix: Incorrect Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-63851.c at lines 35-46 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability results from a race condition due to the lack of proper synchronization when handling multiple clients. Specifically, the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable are accessed and modified by multiple threads without mutex protection, leading to possible inconsistent state or data races.
where: falcon180b-63851.c, lines 35-46
why: Not resolving this weakness can lead to undefined behavior, such as crashes, corrupt data, or even security breaches where an attacker can exploit the race condition to perform unauthorized actions.
how: An attacker could exploit this by rapidly connecting and disconnecting with the server, causing race conditions to occur frequently. This can lead to the overwriting of the clients array, potential DoS attacks, or even crashes of the server process.
code-sources: The entry point for user input would be `recv(client_socket, buffer, BUFFER_SIZE, 0);` in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: The data received is immediately printed using `printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);` and broadcasted to other clients using `send(clients[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0);`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by introducing a mutex (`clients_mutex`) to properly synchronize access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. This ensures that these shared resources are not concurrently accessed and modified by multiple threads, preventing race conditions and maintaining their integrity.
