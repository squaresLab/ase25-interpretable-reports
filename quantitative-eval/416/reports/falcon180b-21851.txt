vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-21851 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a potential buffer overflow vulnerability. When receiving data from the client, the buffer size is fixed to `MAX_DATA_SIZE` bytes. If a client sends more data than `MAX_DATA_SIZE`, the `send` function may receive an improperly null-terminated string, leading to unexpected behavior.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `handle_client` function, particularly around line 15 and line 20 in file falcon180b-21851.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could allow an attacker to exploit the buffer and send arbitrary data that may cause the program to crash, behave unexpectedly, or even allow remote code execution.
how: An attacker could connect to the server and send a specially crafted message larger than `MAX_DATA_SIZE` to trigger a buffer overflow, potentially gaining control of the server or causing it to crash.
code-sources: 
- `recv(client_socket, buffer, MAX_DATA_SIZE, 0)` in `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: 
- `send(client_sockets[i], buffer, strlen(buffer), 0)` in `handle_client` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code change adds an additional check to ensure the number of bytes received is less than `MAX_DATA_SIZE`. If the number of bytes received is equal to or greater than `MAX_DATA_SIZE`, the connection is closed. Also, the buffer is explicitly null-terminated by setting `buffer[bytes_received]` to '\0' to prevent any potential buffer overflow.
method: UNKNOWN
