vuln-fix: Improper Synchronization (CWE-362) in falcon180b-63538 on lines 61-79 (severity: high)
what: The code to handle new client connections in the main function does not properly synchronize access to the `clients` array and the `num_clients` global variable. Multiple threads can simultaneously access and modify these shared resources, leading to race conditions.
where: Lines 61-79 in the `main` function of file falcon180b-63538:
```c
if (num_clients >= MAX_CLIENTS) {
    printf("Maximum clients reached\n");
    close(client_socket);
    continue;
}

clients[num_clients][0] = client_socket;
clients[num_clients][1] = client_socket;
num_clients++;

pthread_t thread_id;
pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);
```
why: Failing to resolve this race condition can result in unpredictable behavior, such as memory corruption, clients being overwritten, or even causing the server to crash.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by concurrently initiating connections to the server in quick succession, potentially causing race conditions due to unsynchronized access to shared global variables `clients` and `num_clients`.
code-sources: The `accept` call for client connections in the main function.
code-sinks: The `clients` array and `num_clients` global variable assignments and modifications in the main function.

        pthread_create(&thread_id, NULL, handle_client, (void *) &client_socket);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a `pthread_mutex_t clients_mutex` to provide mutual exclusion for access to the `clients` array and `num_clients` variable. By calling `pthread_mutex_lock` before modifying these variables and `pthread_mutex_unlock` afterwards, we prevent race conditions and ensure that access to shared resources is properly synchronized.
