vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-33833 (severity: High)
what: The code constructs an HTTP response using multiple `strcat` calls which concatenate strings onto the `response` buffer without checking the length of the concatenated data. This can lead to a buffer overflow if the total size of the concatenated strings exceeds `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`.
where: Lines involving `strcat` in `handle_client` function, starting around `line 18` in `falcon180b-33833`.
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or crashing the server.
how: An attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP request that results in a response whose length exceeds `MAX_REQUEST_SIZE`, causing the buffer `response` to overflow and corrupt adjacent memory.
code-sources: Input from `recv` function on `line 13` in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks: `strcat` operations on `line 18`, `line 20`, `line 21`, `line 22`, `line 23` and `line 24` in the `handle_client` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff changes string concatenation operations from `strcat` to `snprintf` and `strncat`, ensuring bounds checking on the `response` buffer to prevent buffer overflow. `snprintf` limits the total number of characters written to the buffer, and `strncat` ensures that the buffer is not overflowed by concatenation operations.
