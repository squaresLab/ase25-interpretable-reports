vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-25274 at line numbers 14-20 (severity: High)
    
what: The vulnerability here is a buffer overflow in the `handle_client` function. The `recv` function can read more bytes into the `buffer` than its capacity, 1024 bytes. This can lead to overwriting adjacent memory and causing undefined behavior, crashes, or potential remote code execution.

where: The vulnerability is located in `falcon180b-25274`, in lines 14-20 within the `handle_client` function:
```C
void *handle_client(void *arg) {
    int client_socket = *(int *) arg;
    char buffer[1024];
    while (1) {
        memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
        int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
        if (bytes_received <= 0) {
            close(client_socket);
            return NULL;
        }
        printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
    }
}
```

why: If this buffer overflow is not resolved, it could lead to remote code execution by an attacker, enabling them to take control of the server and compromise other systems and data.

how: An attacker could send a payload larger than 1024 bytes to overflow the buffer. This could overwrite the return address of the function, redirecting execution to malicious code injected by the attacker.

code-sources: The entry point of user input occurs at the call to `recv` within the `handle_client` function:
```C
int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
```

code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input are printing the input with `printf` and processing it within the `while` loop:
```C
printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
```

suggested-fix:
```diff
 int client_socket = *(int *) arg;
 char buffer[1024];
 while (1) {
     memset(buffer, 0, sizeof(buffer));
-    int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer), 0);
+    int bytes_received = recv(client_socket, buffer, sizeof(buffer) - 1, 0);
     if (bytes_received <= 0) {
         close(client_socket);
         return NULL;
     }
+    buffer[bytes_received] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the buffer
     printf("Client %d sent: %s\n", client_socket, buffer);
 }
```

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested changes ensure that the `recv` function reads at most `sizeof(buffer) - 1` bytes from the client, leaving space for a null-terminator. Additionally, we manually set the null-terminator to prevent potential buffer overflow and undefined behavior due to improperly formatted strings.
