    vuln-fix: CWE-362: Race Condition in falcon180b-42921 (severity: High)
    what: The code has a race condition vulnerability due to improper synchronization when checking `num_clients` and modifying the `clients` array.
    where: Lines 56-66 in falcon180b-42921.
    why: An attacker could exploit this race condition to create more client connections than allowed, which could lead to resource exhaustion on the server.
    how: An attacker could rapidly connect to the server, potentially allowing multiple threads to modify `clients` and `num_clients` without proper synchronization, exceeding the maximum client limit.
    code-sources: The entry point is the client connection accepted at line 56 in the `accept` function.
    code-sinks: The vulnerability arises when `num_clients` and `clients` are manipulated without proper locking in lines 61-66.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff introduces a semaphore (`client_semaphore`) to ensure that the critical section where `num_clients` and `clients` are modified is protected. By using `sem_wait` and `sem_post` around this critical section, we ensure that only one thread can access and modify these variables at a time, preventing race conditions.
