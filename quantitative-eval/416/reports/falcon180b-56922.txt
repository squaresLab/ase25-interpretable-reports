    vuln-fix: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions (CWE-755) in falcon180b-56922 (severity: High)
    what: The code has a critical vulnerability where the server_socket is used before being properly initialized with socket(). This can cause undefined behavior and potentially server crashes.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the main function:
    - Missing `socket` initialization before: `setsockopt(server_socket, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, &opt, sizeof(opt));`
    - Before `bind`, `listen` and `accept`: missing initialization of server_socket.
    why: Not resolving this weakness can lead to server instability, unexpected crashes, and denial of service for clients.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malformed or unexpected requests that exploit the uninitialized server_socket, leading to the server crashing or behaving unpredictably.
    code-sources: Entry point is the accept() call in the main function where client connections are accepted.
    code-sinks: Actions using client input are the recv() and send() functions in the handle_client function.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff initializes the server_socket by using the socket() function before it is used in setsockopt(), bind(), listen(), and accept() functions. It also adds error handling for socket creation and binding to ensure the server does not start without a valid socket.
