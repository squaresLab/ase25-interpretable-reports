vuln-fix: CWE-825 in falcon180b-64585 (severity: High)
what: A function returns a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory. This memory is deallocated at the end of the function, which may lead the caller to dereference a dangling pointer.
where: Located the vulnerabilities at lines 21 and 23 in the file falcon180b-64585.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential security vulnerabilities due to dereferencing a dangling pointer.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making the program operate on a dangling pointer, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or security breaches if sensitive memory regions are accessed or corrupted.
code-sources: The entry point in the code where user input enters is the `main` function's argument `argv[1]`.
code-sinks: The actions performed by the application using user input are within the `sanitize_url` function.

    if (sanitized_url == NULL) {
        return NULL;
    }

    for (i = 0, j = 0; url[i] != '\0'; i++) {
-        char* sanitized_char = sanitize_char(url[i]);

-        if (sanitized_char != NULL) {
-            sanitized_url[j++] = *sanitized_char;
+        char sanitized_char = sanitize_char(url[i]);

+        if (sanitized_char != '\0') {
+            sanitized_url[j++] = sanitized_char;
        }
    }

    sanitized_url[j] = '\0';

    return sanitized_url;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff changes the return type of the `sanitize_char` function from `char*` to `char`. Instead of returning a pointer to a local variable, it now returns the character itself. This eliminates the risk of returning a pointer to a stack-allocated region of memory, thereby preventing the caller from dereferencing a dangling pointer.
