vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in falcon180b-25160.c (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to the use of `recv` function without proper validation of the received data size. This can lead to potentially writing beyond the bounds of the buffer.
where: Lines 19-28 in the file `falcon180b-25160.c`
why: Not resolving this weakness can allow an attacker to perform arbitrary code execution, crash the server leading to a denial of service, or corrupt data.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets that exceed the buffer size of 1024 bytes, causing the buffer to overflow and potentially execute malicious code.
code-sources: 
- `recv` function call on line 22 in the `handle_client` function.
code-sinks:
- `send` function call on line 27 using the buffer received from `recv`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix modifies the `recv` function call to ensure that no more than `BUFFER_SIZE - 1` bytes are received, allowing space for the null-terminator. It also adds a null-terminator explicitly to enforce proper string termination, preventing buffer overflow. An additional check is added to ensure the `client_socket` is valid.
