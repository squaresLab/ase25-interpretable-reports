    vuln-fix: CWE-415 Double Free in gemma7b-10221 (severity: High)
    what: The code has a vulnerability where memory is allocated for `reader->buffer` and then reallocated inside the `csv_reader_read` function without freeing the previously allocated memory. This leads to a double free vulnerability when `csv_reader_destroy` is called.
    where: Lines 20-25 in the file gemma7b-10221.
    why: If not resolved, this weakness might be exploited to cause a crash, potentially enabling a Denial of Service (DoS) or arbitrary code execution.
    how: An attacker could craft a malicious CSV file designed to manipulate the allocation and deallocation process, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes in the application.
    code-sources: csv_reader_init - File reading operation can be controlled by providing a specific filename.
    code-sinks: csv_reader_read - While reading the file it reallocates buffer (sink) for each line read.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff resolves the vulnerability by performing a proper reallocation procedure. Instead of reallocating memory directly at each iteration, it now increases the buffer size exponentially, reducing the number of realloc calls and ensuring that memory is properly managed within bounds. Additionally, it ensures that each string in the buffer is freed before freeing the buffer itself in the `csv_reader_destroy` method.
    method: UNKNOWN
