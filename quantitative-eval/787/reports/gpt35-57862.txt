vuln-fix: CWE-367: Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition in gpt35-57862 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerable code has a race condition due to non-atomic checks and state changes on shared resources `visited`, `path`, and `path_len`. Multiple threads check and modify these shared variables without proper synchronization.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `dfs` function and occurs around the lines manipulating `visited`, `path`, and `path_len` in the file `gpt35-57862`. Specifically:
```
    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (maze[i][j] == 0 && !visited[i][j]) {
                visited[i][j] = true;
                path[path_len++] = data->nodes[i * m + j];

                if (i == n - 1 && j == m - 1) {
                    return NULL;
                }

                dfs(arg);

                if (path_len > 0) {
                    path_len--;
                }
                visited[i][j] = false;
            }
        }
    }
```
why: If this weakness is not resolved, multiple threads can lead to inconsistent and incorrect state in the `visited`, `path`, and `path_len` variables, possibly causing incorrect pathfinding results or a crash.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by inducing timing conditions that make multiple threads access and modify shared resources simultaneously, leading to race conditions and undefined behavior.
code-sources: The code source where user input is provided is in the `inputMaze` function:
```
void inputMaze() {
    scanf("%i %i", &n, &m);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            int val;
            scanf("%i", &val);
            maze[i][j] = val;
        }
    }
}
```
code-sinks: The sink in this code is the `dfs` function, which uses the user input to navigate the maze:
```
void *dfs(void *arg)
```
suggested-fix: 
```diff
void *dfs(void *arg) {
    ThreadData *data = (ThreadData *) arg;

    int idx = data->idx;
    int start = idx * (data->n / MAX_THREADS);
    int end = (idx + 1) * (data->n / MAX_THREADS);

    if (idx == MAX_THREADS - 1) {
        end = data->n;
    }

    for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);
            if (maze[i][j] == 0 && !visited[i][j]) {
                visited[i][j] = true;
                path[path_len++] = data->nodes[i * m + j];

                if (i == n - 1 && j == m - 1) {
                    pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex); // Unlock before returning
                    return NULL;
                }

                pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex); // Unlock before recursive call
                dfs(arg);
                pthread_mutex_lock(&mutex);

                if (path_len > 0) {
                    path_len--;
                }
                visited[i][j] = false;
            }
            pthread_mutex_unlock(&mutex);
        }
    }

    return NULL;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The modifications involve adding a mutex lock around the critical sections of the code where the `visited`, `path`, and `path_len` variables are checked and modified. This ensures that only one thread can access these critical sections at a time, preventing race conditions.
