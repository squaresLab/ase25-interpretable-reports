vuln-fix: CWE-119: Buffer Overflow in gemma7b-5691 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly check array bounds when accessing the `knights` array, particularly in the `clusterKnights` function, which could lead to writing outside the bounds of the array.
where: In the `gemma7b-5691` file, specifically in the `clusterKnights` function starting at line 16.
why: If not resolved, this vulnerability can lead to buffer overflow, which can be exploited by attackers to crash the program, corrupt data, or execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing an input that exceeds the bounds of the `knights` array, causing the program to write outside the allocated memory buffer, leading to potential execution of arbitrary harmful code.
code-sources: The `knights` array in the `main` function, and the parameters `Knight **knights` and `int numKnights` in the `clusterKnights` function.
code-sinks: The indexes `i` and `j` used to access elements from the `knights` array within the nested loops in the `clusterKnights` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff adds checks to ensure that array indices `i` and `j` are within valid bounds before accessing elements from the `knights` array. This prevents buffer overflow by ensuring the program does not read or write outside the allocated bounds of the array.
