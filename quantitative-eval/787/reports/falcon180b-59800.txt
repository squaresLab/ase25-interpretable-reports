vuln-fix: CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer in falcon180b-59800 at lines 56-60 (severity: high)
what: The code attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer, specifically in the qsort and the subsequent printf operations which use the `wordsCount` array that wasn't correctly filled as `numWords` remains zero.
where: In file falcon180b-59800 at lines 56-60 during the `qsort` and `for` loop.
why: If this vulnerability is not addressed, an attacker could exploit it to cause a program crash, leading to a denial of service (DoS) or potentially execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker would need to craft a specific log file to influence the behavior when the program processes the log, manipulating it to access or overwrite memory locations after the array's boundary.
code-sources: `logfile.txt` opened and read in the `main` function.
code-sinks: `wordsCount` array accessed and manipulated in the `main` function and used in the `qsort` and `printf`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff initializes `numWords` with `totalWords` correctly reflecting the actual number of words read, and each word's count is initialized. These changes ensure that the buffer is not accessed beyond its allocated boundaries by `qsort` or `printf`, preventing memory access violations.
