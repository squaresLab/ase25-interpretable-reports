    vuln-fix: CWE-119 Buffer Overflow in gpt35-14543 (severity: High)
    what: The `recv` function in both `ping_host` and `traceroute` functions does not adequately handle the size of received packets, which can lead to a buffer overflow.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `ping_host` function at the line where `recv(sockfd, buffer, ICMP_PACKET_SIZE, 0)` is called and in the `traceroute` function at `recv(sockfd, buffer, ICMP_PACKET_SIZE, 0)`.
    why: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access or control over the application.
    how: An attacker could exploit this by sending a larger ICMP packet than expected, overflowing the buffer and potentially executing malicious code within the context of the application.
    code-sources: The user input enters the application via `char* hostname` in both `ping_host` and `traceroute` functions, derived from command-line arguments.
    code-sinks: The `recv` function is where the potentially unsafe user input (received packet size) interacts with the buffer.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The recommended code diff changes the `recv` function to read at most the size of the buffer, preventing buffer overflows by ensuring that received data does not exceed the allocated buffer size.
    method: UNKNOWN
