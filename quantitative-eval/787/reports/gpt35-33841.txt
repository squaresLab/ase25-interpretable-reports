vuln-fix: cpp/unbounded-write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gpt35-33841, lines 168 and 178 (severity: High)
what: Buffer write operations that do not control the length of data written may overflow.
where: 
- Line 168: scanf("%s", name);
- Line 178: scanf("%s", name);
why: An unbounded write can lead to a buffer overflow, which can be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a program crash.
how: An attacker could provide input longer than the allocated buffer size, leading to memory corruption and potential execution of malicious code.
code-sources: 
- Lines 168 and 178: `scanf("%s", name);`
code-sinks: 
- Lines 168 and 178: `create_file(&fs, name, size);` and `delete_file(&fs, name);`

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by specifying a format string in the `scanf` function that limits the input size to the buffer size minus one (to account for the null terminator), preventing buffer overflow.
