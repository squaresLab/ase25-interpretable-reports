    vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gpt35-51720 (line 47) (severity: High)
    what: The code contains a buffer overflow vulnerability due to an unrestricted write operation 
          that can exceed the allocated buffer size.
    where: Line 47 in gpt35-51720:
    ```
        sprintf(name, "Bidder #%d", i+1);
    ```
    why: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code, cause program crashes, or corrupt memory.
    how: An attacker could provide input that results in writing more data to the buffer than it can handle, 
         leading to overflow and subsequently allowing execution of malicious code or disruption of program flow.
    code-sources: User input enters through id values manipulated within the program and potentially external sources.
    code-sinks: Vulnerable `sprintf` function that writes formatted data to a string.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The use of `snprintf` instead of `sprintf` adds a limit to the number of characters written to the buffer, 
                               preventing overflow by ensuring that only a defined number of characters will be written, in this case ensuring it fits within the buffer size of 10 characters.
