    vuln-fix: CWE-121 Stack-based Buffer Overflow in gpt35-11289 receive_ping_packet function (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability in the code is due to a potential stack-based buffer overflow in the receive_ping_packet function. Specifically, the array recv_buff of icmp_echo_packet structures is declared with a size of MAX_PACK_SIZE, but recvfrom() can write more data into it than what fits within the declared structure size.
    where: Line number 48 (`struct icmp_echo_packet recv_buff[MAX_PACK_SIZE];`) and line number 58 (`recvfrom(sockfd, &recv_buff, recv_buff_size, 0, src_addr, &src_addr_len)`) in the file gpt35-11289.
    why: If not resolved, an attacker could exploit this weakness to execute arbitrary code on the machine, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system or causing a system crash.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted ICMP packet that overflows the recv_buff buffer, allowing them to overwrite control information on the stack and execute arbitrary code.
    code-sources: For this application, user input comes from the command-line argument (IP address) passed to the argv array in the main function.
    code-sinks: User input from the command-line argument is used to resolve the hostname and create a socket connection. It is then indirectly used within sendto() and recvfrom() functions in the send_ping_packet and receive_ping_packet functions respectively.

    explanation-suggested-fix: This code diff ensures that the recvfrom() function call does not exceed the size allocated for the recv_buff buffer. It limits recvfrom() to read a maximum of MAX_PACK_SIZE bytes and an additional check is added to verify that the received packet size does not exceed the size of the icmp_echo_packet structure. If the packet size exceeds, it prints an error message and breaks out of the processing loop, preventing a potential buffer overflow.
