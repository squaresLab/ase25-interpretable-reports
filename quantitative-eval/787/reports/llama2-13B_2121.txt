vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in llama2-13B_2121 (severity: High)
what: The code does not check that the coordinates of the puzzle pieces are within the bounds of the `assembled` array, leading to potential out-of-bounds writes.
where: In the `assemble_puzzle` function, specifically lines 19-21 in the llama2-13B_2121 file.
why: If not resolved, the out-of-bounds write can corrupt memory, potentially altering the program's behavior, leading to crashes, or creating security vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit.
how: An attacker can manipulate the input to provide coordinates that are outside the bounds of the `assembled` array, which could lead to arbitrary code execution or crashes.
code-sources: The user input is assumed to be provided to the `assemble_puzzle` function through the `pieces` array and `num_pieces` integer.
code-sinks: The operations on `assembled[piece->x][piece->y]` in the `assemble_puzzle` function.

// Define a struct to represent a puzzle piece
struct puzzle_piece {
    char symbol; // the symbol on the puzzle piece
    int x; // the x-coordinate of the puzzle piece

};

// Define a function to parse the puzzle pieces and put them together
void assemble_puzzle(struct puzzle_piece** pieces, int num_pieces) {
    // Create a 2D array to store the assembled puzzle
    char assembled[num_pieces][3];
    
    // Initialize the assembled array with a default value

    for (int i = 0; i < num_pieces; i++) {

        if (piece->x >= 0 && piece->x < num_pieces && piece->y >= 0 && piece->y < 3) {
            // If the piece is not already in the assembled puzzle, add it
            if (strchr(assembled[piece->x][piece->y], piece->symbol) == NULL) {
                assembled[piece->x][piece->y] = piece->symbol;

    // Print the assembled puzzle
    for (int i = 0; i < num_pieces; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
            printf("%c", assembled[i][j]);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
}

int main() {
    // Define an array of puzzle pieces
    struct puzzle_piece pieces[5] = {
        {'A', 0, 0},
        {'B', 1, 0},
        {'C', 2, 0},
        {'D', 0, 1},
        {'E', 1, 1}
    };

    // Call the function to assemble the puzzle
    assemble_puzzle(pieces, 5);

    return 0;
}
```
explanation-suggested-fix: Adding boundary checks for the `x` and `y` coordinates ensures that only valid indices within the `assembled` array are accessed, thus preventing out-of-bounds writes.
