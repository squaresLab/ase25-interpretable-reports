    vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write in gpt35-48884 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in the `addNode` function where `circuit->numNodes` can exceed `MAX_NODES`, leading to a potential overflow of the `nodes` array.
    where: The vulnerability is located in the `addNode` function, specifically at the lines where a new node is added to the circuit:
    
    ```c
    void addNode(Circuit *circuit, char type, float value, int n1, int n2) {
        Node node;
        node.type = type;
        node.value = value;
        node.nodes[0] = n1;
        node.nodes[1] = n2;

        circuit->nodes[circuit->numNodes] = node;
        circuit->numNodes++;
    }
    ```
    why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it could lead to memory corruption, leading to undefined behavior, program crashes, and potential code execution by an attacker.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing input that causes `circuit->numNodes` to exceed `MAX_NODES`, resulting in writing outside the bounds of the allocated array for nodes.
    code-sources: The primary entry point for user input is `addNode`, which processes input parameters `type`, `value`, `n1`, and `n2`. If these parameters are manipulated to add more nodes than allocated space, it causes overflow.
    code-sinks: The actions performed based on user input include the addition of new nodes to the `nodes` array and incrementing `numNodes` without bounds checking.
    suggested-fix: 
    ```diff
    void addNode(Circuit *circuit, char type, float value, int n1, int n2) {
        + if (circuit->numNodes >= MAX_NODES) {
        +     fprintf(stderr, "Error: Attempt to add more nodes than allowed (%d).\n", MAX_NODES);
        +     return;
        + }

        Node node;
        node.type = type;
        node.value = value;
        node.nodes[0] = n1;
        node.nodes[1] = n2;

        circuit->nodes[circuit->numNodes] = node;
        circuit->numNodes++;
    }
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a boundary check before adding a new node. It prevents adding more than `MAX_NODES` nodes by printing an error message and returning early if the limit is exceeded, thus ensuring that the addition operation does not lead to out-of-bounds writes.
    method: UNKNOWN
