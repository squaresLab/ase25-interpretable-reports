    vuln-fix: Unbounded Write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gemini_pro-12710:50,55 (severity: high)
    what: Buffer write operations that do not control the length of data written may overflow.
    where: Line 50 and line 55 in file gemini_pro-12710
    why: Failing to resolve this vulnerability can result in buffer overflow, leading to potential crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing specially crafted inputs that exceed the expected length, leading to buffer overflow.
    code-sources: 
        - scanf("%s", patientName);
        - scanf("%s", medicineName);
    code-sinks: 
        - strcpy(transaction.patientName, patientName);
        - strcpy(transaction.date, "Ye Olde Date");

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the vulnerability by limiting the length of input read by `scanf` to one less than the buffer size, preventing a buffer overflow. Additionally, `strncpy` is used instead of `strcpy` to ensure that only a specified number of characters are copied, offering further protection against buffer overflow.
