 
    vuln-fix: Buffer Over-read (CWE-126) in gemma7b-20082 at lines 13, 47 (severity: High)
    what: There is a buffer over-read vulnerability because the `fgets` function can read more data than the buffer allocated for it, potentially leading to undefined behavior or crashes.
    where: Vulnerability located at line 47 in the `csvReader_getLine` function within the file gemma7b-20082.
    why: If the vulnerability is not resolved, it could lead to abnormal program termination, data corruption, or a security breach through buffer overflow attacks.
    how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a specially crafted input file (`example.csv`), which causes the `fgets` function to read data beyond the allocated buffer memory.
    code-sources: `csvReader_init` function with `filename` parameter.
    code-sinks: `csvReader_getLine` function, particularly the `fgets` call.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The fix ensures that for each line read from the file, there is proper memory allocation to store that line. This prevents the buffer over-read by making sure `fgets` has a sufficiently allocated buffer to read into.
    method: UNKNOWN
