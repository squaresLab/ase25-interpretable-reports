vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-30040 (severity: high)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs in the `add_entry` function when copying a `name` larger than the destination buffer `name` in the `struct entry`.
where: gpt35-30040, lines 36-39
why: Not resolving this weakness could allow an attacker to overwrite critical data structures, leading to application crashes, injection of malicious code, or unauthorized access to sensitive information.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by providing a name input longer than 49 characters (the buffer size is 50 characters, including the null terminator), causing the buffer to overflow and potentially overwriting adjacent memory.
code-sources: `add_entry` method, parameters `name`, `id`, and `age`
code-sinks: `sprintf(e->name, "%s", name)` (line 38) in `add_entry`
suggested-fix: 
```diff
36c36
<         sprintf(e->name, "%s", name);
---
>         strncpy(e->name, name, sizeof(e->name) - 1);
>         e->name[sizeof(e->name) - 1] = '\0';
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix changes the code to use `strncpy` instead of `sprintf` to ensure that no more than `sizeof(e->name) - 1` characters are copied into the `name` buffer, thus preventing buffer overflow. It also explicitly sets the last character to a null terminator to ensure the string is properly terminated.
method: UNKNOWN
