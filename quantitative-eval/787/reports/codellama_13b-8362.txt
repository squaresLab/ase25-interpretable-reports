    vuln-fix: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow in codellama_13b-8362 (severity: High)
    what: The code lacks boundary checks when moving plates, which can lead to stack-based buffer overflows. Specifically, recursive calls to `movePlate` do not properly limit the number of stack frames created, leading to excessive recursion depth that can exhaust stack memory.
    where: Line 13-32 (movePlate function) and Line 36-42 (movePlates function) in codellama_13b-8362
    why: An attacker could exploit this weakness to crash the program or execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the user running the application, resulting in a denial of service or potentially gaining unauthorized control over the system.
    how: An attacker can manipulate the number of plates or the inputs to the `movePlate` function to create a situation where the recursive depth exceeds the stack's capacity, causing a stack overflow.
    code-sources: The input to the program comes from the `main` function where the plates array is defined and used in `movePlates` function calls.
    code-sinks: Actions performed include moving plates from one pole to another within the `movePlate` function without boundary checks.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix incorporates a depth counter into the `movePlate` and `movePlates` functions to ensure that the recursive depth does not exceed a safe limit. This safeguard prevents stack overflow by limiting the number of recursive calls.
