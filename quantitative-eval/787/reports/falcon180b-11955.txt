vuln-fix: CWE-758: Improper Resource Management in falcon180b-11955 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is due to improper resource management where the file pointer is passed as a string instead of a FILE pointer. Additionally, there is no proper error checking when opening files. This can lead to runtime errors or undefined behavior.
where: The vulnerabilities are present in the `insert_row` and `print_table` functions, and their calls in main, specifically in falcon180b-11955 at lines 44, 48, 52, 56, 58, 59, 60, and 61.
why: Failing to properly manage resources can result in runtime errors, application crashes, and undefined behavior. If an attacker exploits this, they could cause a denial of service or manipulate the program's execution.
how: An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting a malicious input to cause the application to crash or behave unpredictably. For example, passing incorrect file pointers as strings can lead to segmentation faults or crashes.
code-sources: No direct user input was observed in the provided code.
code-sinks: The vulnerable sink functions are `insert_row` and `print_table` which improperly handle file pointers.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures proper resource management by validating file pointers when opening files and checking for NULL pointers. This helps prevent runtime errors and potential application crashes due to improper handling of file resources.
