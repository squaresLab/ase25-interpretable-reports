 
vuln-fix: CWE-131: Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size in gemma7b-34762, lines 25 and 29 (severity: High)
what: The code reallocates and allocates memory for buffer without ensuring the correct buffer size calculation, potentially leading to a buffer overflow.
where: Lines 25 (`reader->buffer = realloc(reader->buffer, reader->bufferSize * (reader->currentLine + 1) * sizeof(char *));`) and 29 (`reader->buffer[reader->currentLine] = malloc(MAX_BUFFER_SIZE * sizeof(char));`) in `gemma7b-34762`.
why: If the buffer size is incorrectly calculated, an attacker could cause a buffer overflow, potentially resulting in application crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specially formatted CSV file with enough entries or large enough entries to exceed the allocated buffer size.
code-sources: The filename input to `csvReader_init` function and the content of the CSV file read using `fgets` in `csvReader_readCSV`.
code-sinks: The calls to `realloc` and `malloc` in `csvReader_readCSV`.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff includes checks to ensure that the `realloc` and `malloc` calls are successful, handling potential memory allocation failures appropriately. It also avoids potential integer overflow when calculating the size for reallocating the buffer.
