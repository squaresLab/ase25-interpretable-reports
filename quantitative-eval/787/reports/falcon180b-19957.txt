vuln-fix: CWE-415: Double Free in falcon180b-19957 (severity: High)
what: The code does not properly handle memory allocated by `strdup`. Specifically, there is no handling to free the duplicate strings stored in the `name` fields of `Record` structures, which can lead to a double-free vulnerability if the `add_record` function is called with duplicate names or if memory is manually freed incorrectly.
where: The vulnerability is located at the memory allocation for the `name` field in the `add_record` function.
why: One possible consequence of not resolving this weakness is that an attacker could exploit the double-free vulnerability to execute arbitrary code or to cause a denial of service (e.g., crashing the program).
how: An attacker could insert records with duplicate names, resulting in multiple free operations on the same memory, leading to unpredictable behavior such as crashes or potential execution of malicious code.
code-sources: User input `name`, `age`, and `salary` in the `add_record` function.
code-sinks: The actions performed by `strdup` and freeing of `name` in `add_record`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff adds logic to free previously allocated memory for the `name` field in `add_record`, thereby preventing a memory leak when updating records with new names. Additionally, a new function `free_table` is introduced to free the memory allocated for all `name` fields before the program terminates, ensuring a clean exit without memory issues.
