vuln-fix: Use After Free (CWE-416) in gemini_pro-36214 lines 24, 30, 46, 52, 57, 63, 70, 76 (severity: High)
what: The code contains a Use After Free vulnerability. The memory allocated for candidate and voter names is freed in the `destroy_election` function, but not set to NULL, leaving dangling pointers.
where: The issue occurs in the `destroy_election` function at lines 46-52, where the memory allocated for the candidate and voter names is freed but not set to NULL.
why: If the memory for `name` fields is accessed after it has been freed, it may result in undefined behavior, including program crashes or other security vulnerabilities.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the program to access the freed memory, leading to potential data corruption, leaked sensitive information, or code execution.
code-sources: User inputs are passed through the `vote` function, where `voter_id` and `candidate_id` are used to interact with the `election` struct.
code-sinks: The `free` function in `destroy_election` is a sink where the allocated memory for candidate and voter names is freed.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff modifies the `destroy_election` function to set the `name` pointers to NULL after freeing their allocated memory. This prevents the use of dangling pointers and mitigates the risk of a Use After Free vulnerability.
method: UNKNOWN
