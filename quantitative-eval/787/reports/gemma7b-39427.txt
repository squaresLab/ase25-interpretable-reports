vuln-fix: CWE-415: Double Free in gemma7b-39427.c (severity: High)
what: The code has a vulnerability where memory allocated for `reader->buffer` and `reader->data` is freed twice in the function `freeCSVReader`. This is known as a double-free vulnerability.
where: The double-free issue occurs in `freeCSVReader` function at lines where `free(reader->buffer)` and `free(reader->data)` are called.
why: If not resolved, a double-free vulnerability can lead to undefined behavior, including program crashes, memory corruption, or even the execution of malicious code. This can be exploited by attackers to compromise the system.
how: An attacker could potentially exploit the double-free vulnerability by causing the program to free the same memory space twice. This can corrupt the program's memory management, leading to system instability, crashes, and the possibility of arbitrary code execution.
code-sources: Source of user input is the `createCSVReader` function when opening the file specified by `filename`, and the `fgets` function in `readCSVLine` when reading the CSV lines.
code-sinks: Memory allocation via `realloc` in `readCSVLine` and the deallocation of `buffer` and `data` in `freeCSVReader`.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that individual strings in the `reader->buffer` are freed before the buffer itself is freed, preventing a double-free scenario. Additionally, after freeing, the pointers are set to `NULL` to avoid dangling pointer issues. Memory allocation is also guarded to handle cases where `realloc` fails.
