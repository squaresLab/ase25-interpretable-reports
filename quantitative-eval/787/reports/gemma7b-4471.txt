    vuln-fix: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122) in gemma7b-4471 (severity: High)
    what: The vulnerability arises from improper handling of buffer memory which can lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.
    where: In `csvReader_readNextLine` and `csvReader_getColumn` functions in the file `gemma7b-4471`.
    why: If not resolved, this weakness can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, potentially taking full control of the application.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a specifically designed CSV file to overflow the buffer during the read operation.
    code-sources: ```csvReader_init``` as it initializes the reader with a file provided by the user.
    code-sinks: ```csvReader_readNextLine``` and ```csvReader_getColumn```, where the buffer is reallocated and assigned based on user-provided data.

    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: By using a macro to safely reallocate memory, we ensure that if `realloc` fails, the program exits gracefully with an error message, thereby preventing the heap-based buffer overflow. Additionally, the initial size of `bufferSize` is conditionally determined to ensure it starts from 1, thus preventing undefined behavior when incrementing.
