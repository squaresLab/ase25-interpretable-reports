vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gpt35-47711.c:49-52 (severity: High)
what: The code for finding the shortest path does not check the number of edges which results in potential buffer overflow in edges array.
where: In the `void shortest_path(Graph *g, int src, int dest)` function in `gpt35-47711.c`, lines 49-52.
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, it can lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or allow an attacker to run arbitrary code.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by setting up the `Graph` structure such that `g->num_edges` is larger than the size of the `edges` array (`MAX_NODES * MAX_NODES`). When the loop (lines 49-52) accesses beyond `edges` array, it may cause a buffer overflow.
code-sources: Entry points in the code where user input is taken are the function parameters `num_nodes` and `num_edges` in `init_graph` function.
code-sinks: Actions performed using user input from the source include the loop that initializes edges in the `init_graph` function and loops in `shortest_path` that do not validate bounds.

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code diff resolves the buffer overflow vulnerability by adding checks to ensure that the number of nodes does not exceed `MAX_NODES` and the number of edges does not exceed `MAX_NODES * MAX_NODES`. It also checks that the number of nodes and edges are not negative before initializing the graph. This ensures that the loops in the `shortest_path` function do not operate outside the bounds of the arrays.
