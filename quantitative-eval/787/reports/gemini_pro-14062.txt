    vuln-fix: Unbounded Write (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gemini_pro-14062:175 (severity: HIGH)
    what: The vulnerability is caused by unbounded `strcpy` usage, leading to a potential buffer overflow on line 175.
    where: The vulnerable code is located at line 175 in the file gemini_pro-14062.
    why: If not resolved, this weakness could allow attackers to execute arbitrary code, cause a segmentation fault, or crash the server by overflowing the buffer.
    how: An attacker could send a carefully crafted message that exceeds the allocated buffer size in the `name` field, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially taking control of the server.
    code-sources: User input is sourced from the client's message received through the `recv` function on line 150.
    code-sinks: The unchecked data is copied into the `client->name` buffer using `strcpy` on line 175 without validating the input length.

```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff replaces `strcpy` with `strncpy` to ensure that no more than the size of `client->name` minus one bytes is copied, preventing buffer overflow. It also adds a null-terminator to the destination buffer to maintain string integrity.
