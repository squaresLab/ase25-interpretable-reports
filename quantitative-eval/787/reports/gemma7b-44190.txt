vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gemma7b-44190 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow due to improper validation of array bounds in the `dealCards` function when assigning card values to players.
where: dealCards function in gemma7b-44190, lines dealing with `players[i].cards[j]` assignment.
why: Failure to resolve this buffer overflow can lead to undefined behavior, potentially crashing the program or allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code.
how: An attacker could exploit this by inputting values that exceed the defined boundaries of the array, causing a buffer overflow and potentially overwriting memory locations.
code-sources: 
- `numPlayers` array in `main` and `dealCards` functions.
- `players[numPlayers]` in `dealCards` function.
code-sinks: 
- The nested loop in `dealCards` where card values are assigned.
- The `showCards` function where player names and card values are printed.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The proposed fix prevents buffer overflow by adding boundary checks to ensure that `numPlayers` does not exceed `MAX_NUM_PLAYERS` and `numCards` does not exceed `MAX_NUM_CARDS`. This ensures that array accesses stay within allocated memory bounds and prevents out-of-bounds writes.
