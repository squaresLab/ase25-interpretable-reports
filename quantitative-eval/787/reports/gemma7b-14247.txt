    vuln-fix: Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122) in gemma7b-14247 (severity: High)
    what: The code has a vulnerability where it incorrectly handles the memory allocation for reading lines from a CSV file leading to a potential heap-based buffer overflow.
    where: Lines within the function `csv_reader_read`, specifically around the use of the `getline` function and the memory allocation with `realloc`.
    why: If not resolved, an attacker could cause a buffer overflow which may lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially compromising the system.
    how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by creating a specially crafted CSV file with lines longer than expected, which could overflow the buffer and corrupt memory.
    code-sources: The `main` function, where it opens the file "data.csv" and initializes `CSVReader`.
    code-sinks: The `csv_reader_read` function, where the line from the file is directly put into the buffer without proper allocation, and the memory is not safely managed.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix modifies the call to `getline` to correctly allocate memory for the line. It uses `getline`'s ability to manage the buffer and its size automatically by passing the address of `line` and `len`. Furthermore, `strdup` is used to duplicate the string into new memory before storing it in the buffer, and the temporary line buffer is freed at the end to avoid memory leaks.
    method: UNKNOWN
