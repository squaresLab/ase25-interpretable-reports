vuln-fix: Buffer Overflow (CWE-120) in gemini_pro-11823 at lines 47-52 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs because the `deal_cards` function does not properly check the number of cards left in the deck before dealing.
where: The vulnerability is located in the `deal_cards` function, lines 47-52 in the file gemini_pro-11823.
why: Failing to resolve this weakness can lead to writing beyond the bounds of the array, potentially causing a crash, data corruption, or enabling an attacker to take control of the application.
how: An attacker can manipulate the number of players or cards dealt so that the `num_cards_in_deck` becomes less than zero, causing overwrites in memory and possibly executing arbitrary code.
code-sources: The entry point is the `main` function where `shuffle_deck` and `deal_cards` are called.
code-sinks: The vulnerable actions occur in the `deal_cards` function when the card from an empty deck is assigned to a player's hand.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix adds a check to ensure the deck still has cards before dealing. If the deck is empty, it prints an error message and exits the program, preventing the buffer overflow.
