vuln-fix: Buffer overflow (CWE-120, CWE-787, CWE-805) in gemma7b-26983.c at line 38 (severity: High)
what: The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs due to an uncontrolled length of data written to a buffer in the `csvReader_readCSV` function.
where: The vulnerability is located in the following code snippet within the `csvReader_readCSV` function in gemma7b-26983.c:
```c
strcpy(reader->buffer[reader->currentLineNo - 1], line);
```
why: Not resolving this weakness can lead to serious security issues such as arbitrary code execution, application crashes, or corruption of data.
how: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a CSV file with lines longer than the `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE` (1024 bytes). When such lines are copied into the buffer without checking their length, it may result in a buffer overflow.
code-sources: The source of user input is the CSV file read using the `fgets` function from the file system.
code-sinks: The sink is the `strcpy` function that writes the input data into the `reader->buffer`.

+    reader->buffer[reader->currentLineNo - 1] = strdup(line);
     reader->currentColNo = 0;
 }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix replaces the `strcpy` function with `strdup`. This ensures that a new memory allocation is created for each line read, and the exact content of the line is duplicated safely. It avoids the buffer overflow by dynamically allocating the required space for the duplicated string.
