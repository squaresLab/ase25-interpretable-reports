vuln-fix: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20) in gpt35-25058, lines around main function (severity: Moderate)
what: The code does not perform any validation on the sizes of `num_nodes`, `num_sources`, and `num_probes`, which may cause buffer overflows if the values exceed the defined `MAX_NODES`, `MAX_SOURCES`, and `MAX_PROBES` respectively.
where: Vulnerable code starts around line 21 and includes the `main` function, the `print_circuit` function, and the `simulate_circuit` function in gpt35-25058.
why: If an attacker can control the inputs that determine `num_nodes`, `num_sources`, and `num_probes`, they might cause buffer overflows, leading to potential arbitrary code execution, crashes, or data corruption.
how: An attacker would craft input that sets `num_nodes`, `num_sources`, or `num_probes` to values greater than their respective maximums. This would lead to writing out of bounds of the allocated arrays, causing undefined behavior.
code-sources: The code sets `my_circuit.num_nodes`, `my_circuit.num_sources`, and `my_circuit.num_probes` directly in the `main` function without validation.
code-sinks: The `print_circuit` and `simulate_circuit` functions use `num_nodes`, `num_sources`, and `num_probes` to iterate through the arrays, without checking if they are within the allocated bounds.

 ```explanation-suggested-fix: The code diff adds boundary value checks before setting the values of `num_nodes`, `num_sources`, and `num_probes`. If any of these values exceed the predefined maximums, the program will print an error message and terminate. This prevents writing outside of the bounds of the allocated arrays, thereby mitigating buffer overflow risks.
