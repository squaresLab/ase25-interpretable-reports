vuln-fix: CWE-322: Insecure Computation in falcon180b-33596 (severity: High)
what: The code contains an insecure division by zero operation.
where: Lines 49-51 in `falcon180b-33596`:
why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker can cause a crash by triggering a divide-by-zero operation, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
how: An attacker needs to supply values that will result in a division by zero. In this case, the variable `b` is set to zero, making `a / b` undefined and causing a runtime error.
code-sources: The values for `a` and `b` are directly defined in the `main` function.
code-sinks: The division operation `a / b` in the `main` function.
suggested-fix: 
```diff
49c49
<         int c = a / b;
---
>         if (b == 0) {
>             error_context_add_error(&ctx, "Division by zero error!");
>             longjmp(ctx.env, 1);
>         } else {
>             int c = a / b;
>         }
```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested change adds a check to ensure that `b` is not zero before performing the division. If `b` is zero, an error is logged and a long jump is made to the error-handling code, preventing the division by zero and maintaining application stability.
method: UNKNOWN
