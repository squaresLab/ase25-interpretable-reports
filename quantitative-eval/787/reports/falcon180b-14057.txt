vuln-fix: CWE-119: Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer in falcon180b-14057, lines 60-67 (severity: High)
  
what: The vulnerability arises due to the improper access of elements within the array bounds for `circuit->nodes`. The current implementation of the `simulateCircuit` function does not validate the `numNodes` value, which can lead to memory corruption if `numNodes` exceeds the defined `MAX_NODES`.

where: The code vulnerable is in the `simulateCircuit` function within the file falcon180b-14057, specifically at lines 60-67.

why: If this vulnerability is not resolved, an attacker could exploit it to cause a buffer overflow, leading to potential arbitrary code execution, crashing the program, or corrupting data, compromising the stability and security of the system.

how: An attacker could manipulate the `numNodes` value to be larger than `MAX_NODES` before calling `simulateCircuit`, causing the function to write beyond the allocated bounds of the `nodes` array.

code-sources: The entry point for user input influencing this vulnerability would typically be in functions that set `circuit->numNodes`, such as the `buildCircuit` function or any other initialization functions.

code-sinks: The action that performs operations based on this tainted input is within the `simulateCircuit` function when it iterates over the nodes and modifies their values.

explanation-suggested-fix: By adding a check to validate that `numNodes` does not exceed `MAX_NODES`, we prevent out-of-bounds access to the `nodes` array. This ensures that the program terminates gracefully with an error message if an invalid `numNodes` value is detected, avoiding potential buffer overflow attacks.
