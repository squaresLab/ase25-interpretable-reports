    vuln-fix: CWE-122 Heap-based Buffer Overflow in gemma7b-23126 (severity: high)
    what: The code contains a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. The `csv_reader_read_next_row` function reallocates the buffer incorrectly, leading to potential overflows.
    where: Lines involving realloc and usage of buffer in `csv_reader_read_next_row` function (around line 23-37) in the file `gemma7b-23126`.
    why: This vulnerability can cause the program to crash or allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code by overwriting critical data.
    how: An attacker might craft a specially formatted input file (CSV) with data that causes improper buffer reallocation, leading to an overflow.
    code-sources: `fopen` call in `main` function where the CSV file is opened.
    code-sinks: `fgets` and `strdup` calls in `csv_reader_read_next_row` function.

            // Store the line in the buffer
    ```
    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures that memory allocation is properly adjusted by enhancing the condition and ensuring the reallocated buffer size accounts for a list of string pointers (char *), preventing buffer overflow conditions.
