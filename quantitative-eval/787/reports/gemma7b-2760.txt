    what: The code contains multiple issues with memory allocation and manipulation, primarily incorrect calculation of buffer sizes which can lead to buffer overflows and memory corruption.
    where: Lines 1-59 in gemma7b-2760
    why: Not resolving this weakness can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially taking control of the system on which the application is running.
    how: An attacker could supply a specially crafted CSV file with lines longer than `MAX_BUFFER_SIZE`, causing the application to allocate insufficient memory and write out of bounds, leading to memory corruption.
    code-sources: The `csv_reader_init` function where `filename` is passed from the main function and the `csv_reader_parse` function where the data is read from the file.
    code-sinks: The usage of `malloc`, `realloc`, and `strdup` for memory allocations in `csv_reader_parse` and the loops that copy line content to buffer without proper bounds checking.

    explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix ensures proper memory allocation by allocating the total required buffer size at once using `malloc`, avoiding multiple `realloc` calls and potential overflows. Additionally, `strcpy` is used to safely copy the line data into the allocated buffer.
