vuln-fix: CWE-787: Out-of-Bounds Write in gemini_pro-4687 (severity: High)
what: The code is performing out-of-bounds writes in the `init_game` function by incorrectly initializing the positions of player's pieces on the board. There is also an issue in the `print_board` function where it prints outside the boundaries of the array.
where: 
  - In `init_game` function, lines within `gemini_pro-4687` where `game->players[0].pieces[i].position.x = i % 4 + 1;` and `game->players[0].pieces[i].position.y` and similarly for `game->players[1]`.
  - In `print_board` function, lines within `gemini_pro-4687` where `for (int j = 1; j <= BOARD_SIZE; j++) {` impacts the `printf("%c  ", game->board[i - 1][j - 1].type);`.
why: Not resolving this weakness could lead to undefined behavior, crashes, or potential code execution by attackers due to writing outside the bounds of allocated memory.
how: An attacker might feed crafted input data or exploit the code paths that manipulate the `game` object's board and pieces structure, leading to overwriting critical parts of memory.
code-sources: The initialization loop in `init_game` where it sets the positions for `game->players[0].pieces[i].position` and `game->players[1].pieces[i].position`.
code-sinks: The printing loop in `print_board` where the values from `game->board` are accessed without bounds checking.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested code changes ensure that index values do not exceed the array bounds by adjusting initialization loops to correctly map within boundary limits (0 to BOARD_SIZE-1). It also corrects the off-by-one error in the `print_board` function by starting loop indices from 0 instead of 1.
