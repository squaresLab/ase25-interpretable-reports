vuln-fix: Out-of-Bounds Write (CWE-787) in gpt35-67438 (severity: High)
what: The function `evaluate` contains a potential out-of-bounds write vulnerability when setting the `out` variable based on the `input` array from the `Gate` structure.
where: Line 21, 22, `c->gates[i].input[0]` and `c->gates[i].input[1]` in the `evaluate` function, file gpt35-67438
why: An attacker can cause an out-of-bounds write which can corrupt data, crash the application, or in the worst case, lead to arbitrary code execution.
how: An attacker controlling the `input` values of the `Circuit` object or manipulating the `vals` input to the `evaluate` function can lead to the out-of-bounds write being exploited.
code-sources: The entry point is the `vals` array passed to the `evaluate` function from the `main` function.
code-sinks: The risky actions occur at `c->gates[i].input[0]` and `c->gates[i].input[1]` used within the `evaluate` function.

```
explanation-suggested-fix: The addition of bounds checks ensures that the indices accessed in the `input` array are within valid bounds, preventing potential out-of-bounds writes.
