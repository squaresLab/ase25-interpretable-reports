# **CWE-676,120 -- Insecure Use strcat fn** (<span style="color:red">**HIGH**</span>)


We observed that you are using `strcat` or `strncat` functions, Which can lead to buffer overflow vulnerabilities as it does not affirm the size of the destination array and does not automatically NULL-terminate strings. We recommend you to apply bound checking or null terminator.

### Explain 

**PROMPT**: Explain the "CWE-676,120 -- Insecure Use strcat fn" issue in the following code: ```strcat(english_sentence, english_word);```

**TOOL**: The "CWE-676,120 -- Insecure Use strcat fn" vulnerability occurs when using the `strcat` or `strncat` functions in an insecure manner, which can lead to buffer overflows. These functions do not check the size of the destination buffer and do not automatically null-terminate the resulting string, making it easy to write beyond the allocated memory space.

Here's an example in C that demonstrates an integer overflow vulnerability and how to fix it:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main () {
    // Vulnerable code
    char buffer[10];
    strcpy(buffer, "hello");
    strcat(buffer, " world"); // Buffer overflow
    printf("%s\n", buffer); 

    // Fixed code
    char safe_buffer[20];
    strcpy(safE_buffer, "Hello");
    if (strlen(safe_buffer) + strlen(" world") < sizeof(safe_buffer)){
        strcat(safe_buffer, " world");
        printf("%s\n", safe_buffer); 
   
    } else {
        printf("Buffer too small to concatenate\n")
    }
    
    return 0;
}

```

In the vulnerable code, we initialize a character array `buffer`with a size of 10 bytes and copy the string "Hello" into it using `strcpy`. Then, we attempt to concatenate the string "World" to `buffer` using `strcat`. However, the resulting string "Hello World" is 11 characters long (including the null terminator), which exceeds the size of `buffer`. This leads to a buffer overflow, where the extra characters overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially causing undefined behavior or security vulnerabilities. 
 
To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the destination `buffer` is large enough to accommodate the concatenated string. In the fixed code, we allocate a larger buffer `safe_buffer` with a size of 20 bytes. Before concatenating the strings, we check if the combined length of the existing string and the string to be appended is less than the size of `safe_buffer`. If the combined length fits, we safely concatenate the strings using `strcat`. Otherwise, we print an error message indicating that the buffer is too small.

The recommended approach to prevent buffer overflows when using string manipulation 
functions is to: 
1. Use safer alternatives like `strncat` or `snprintf` that allow specifying the maximum 
size of the destination buffer. 
2. Always check the size of the destination buffer before performing string operations. 
3. Use dynamic memory allocation or fixed-size buffers large enough to accommodate 
the expected string lengths. 
4. Validate and sanitize input data to prevent malicious buffer overflows. 
 
By following these practices, you can mitigate the risk of buffer overflow vulnerabilities and 
ensure the security and reliability of your software.
