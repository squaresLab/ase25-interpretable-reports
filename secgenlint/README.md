## Overview

SECGENLint helps security researchers and developers ensure their vulnerability reports follow best practices by:
- Validating report structure and completeness
- Checking for required sections and tags
- Measuring compliance against interpretability standards
- Providing actionable feedback for improvements

## Features

SECGENLint validates reports against the following criteria:
- **Header Section Validation**
  - Presence of vulnerability type and CWE info
  - File location and line number verification
  - Severity level checks

- **Summary Section Checks**
  - Completeness of what/where/why/how explanations
  - Length and content quality validation
  - Clear vulnerability description verification

- **Program Analysis Validation**
  - Source and sink identification
  - Data flow documentation checks
  - Code location accuracy

- **Fix Section Requirements**
  - Presence of concrete fix suggestions
  - Quality of fix explanations
  - Code diff format validation

- **Methodology Documentation**
  - Detection method verification
  - Tool usage documentation
  - Analysis approach validation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Python Environment**
   - Python v3.9.20 or later

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/XXX
   cd secgenlint
   ```

   ```

## Usage

### Command-line Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description | Default |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `--help` | `-h` | Show help message | - |
| `--version` | `-v` | Show version | - |
| `--input-file` | `-i` | Report file to validate | Required |
| `--output-file` | `-o` | Compliance report output | Required |

### Example Usage

1. **Sample Vulnerability Report** (`report.txt`):
```
vuln: Use-After-Free (CWE-416) in sample.c lines 11 (severity: High) 

what: The vulnerability arises when the code tries to access memory through a pointer that has been previously freed, resulting in undefined behavior.
where: The vulnerability is located at lines 11 in the file sample.c.
why: If not resolved, this weakness can lead to a variety of problems, including crashes, unexpected behavior, or even code execution by an attacker.
how: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by manipulating the pointer to access freed memory, potentially leading to memory corruption or arbitrary code execution.

code-sources: The code source is the assignment of `data` and misuse assigning `data` to `invalid_ptr` after `freeMemory(&data)` is called.
code-sinks: The problematic action occurs when `process(invalid_ptr)` is called, which tries to dereference a pointer that points to freed memory.

suggested-fix:
--- a/sample.c
+++ b/fixed_sample.c
@@ -7,8 +7,11 @@ void freeMemory(int **ptr) {
 }
 
 void process(int *ptr) {
-    // Simulate some processing without realizing ptr was freed
-    printf("Processing value: %d\n", *ptr);
+    if (ptr != NULL) {  // Check if the pointer is NULL before accessing
+        printf("Processing value: %d", *ptr);
+    } else {
+        fprintf(stderr, "Error: Trying to access memory through a NULL pointer.");
+    }
 }

explanation-suggested-fix: The suggested fix introduces a check in the `process` function to ensure that it does not attempt to access memory through a NULL pointer. This prevents the program from attempting to dereference a pointer that has been freed and set to NULL, thereby avoiding the use-after-free vulnerability.
```

2. **Run Validation**
```bash
secgenlint --input-file report.txt --output-file compliance-report.txt
```

3. **Compliance Report** (`compliance-report.txt`):
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Summary has more than 500 chars. [summary_max_length]
